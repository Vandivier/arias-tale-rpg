## Technical User Notes

The user guide is located [here](https://ariastale.com/game-manual).

### Other Notes and TODO

1. TODO: Watch "The Peripheral" Prime Video series which apparently has related themes. Players are seemingly locked in a game world, but it turns out they are actually transported into another time-space location in the real world.
2. Misc tropes and plot concepts
   1. Mathlete Class and [the Inverse Algorithmic Cosine Rule](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J5DgMm14ioc)
   2. aria illusions to programming (ie blindness, accessibility stuff)
   3. more math tropes + cs tropes:
      1. even/odd
      2. prime
      3. letter-number or letter-symbol interactions
      4. rational v irrational (pi, e...)
      5. infinities and set theory
      6. uniqueness of one and math ops (multiply, divide...it's 1)
      7. programming error tropes: out of range, out of memory, stack overflow, recursion (ground hog's day), potentially intersect w irrational numbers and/or infinites and set theory
      8. negatives and zero
      9. sequences: fib, geo, fractal...
      10. logarithms (cs base 2 vs base e vs base 10)
      11. 42 and the meaning of life, 420
      12. geometrica or religious numerology (6, 7, 36, 49...)
      13. b64 encoding/decoding
      14. statistical tropes (estimate 2, find 1 and 3...) - economist class?
      15. python as a "language" and possibly other accidental code references leading to bugs, wormholes, loopholes, migraines, and plot twists
   4. Dad jokes as game mechanics (eg "spring water" improving jump ability)
   5. Everything is a mimick, everything is a cake, the cake is a mimick
