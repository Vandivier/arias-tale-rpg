   19. Dragonica is a vast and diverse land where the powerful dragons reign over mountains, forests, and seas. To the north, human settlements dot the landscape, forming a border of villages and towns where humans live under the looming presence of the dragons, forging alliances and defending against threats from the wild lands. The west is home to scattered demon outposts, where demonic forces seek a foothold in the region, clashing with the natural order and drawing suspicion from the other inhabitants, and sometimes forming alliances with the dragons and dwarves that occupy the western mountains of Dragonic. Between these borders lies the heart of Dragonica: towering mountain ranges and occasional plains and desert. Lakes and forests are rare.

### Region 15: Sylara

Sylara is known as "Mist and Mirrors," a region of mysterious and shifting landscapes. Characterized by its abundant enchanted lakes and mirror-like pools, Sylara's geography is ever-changing due to an ancient magic that distorts and blends its features over time. Travelers often find themselves lost in its reflective waters, and legends tell of those who have walked into the lakes, only to emerge years later without having aged a day.

#### Notable Towns and Regions

1. The Mirage Plains in the north, which are often covered in mist.
2. The Greater Sylara Peak, which gives rise to the Sylara River. The Sylara river runs south into the ocean.
3. The Lesser Sylara Peak, which is smaller, to the south, and does not feed a river.
4. Sylara Way, a valley between these peaks which is heavily forested. These forests often have a heavy fog, although the fog is tends to be absent when the moon is full.
5. The Sylara River itself, a great river forming the eastern boundary of the region.
6. The Shifting Lakes, a marshy region in the south of Sylara with many lakes and plains that often flood.

#### Geography

Shifting Lakes: Sylara is dotted with hundreds of lakes that appear to be made of liquid silver, reflecting the sky and surrounding landscape with perfect clarity. These lakes are believed to be entrances to an alternate, mirror dimension where time moves differently, and the reflections show both past and future events.

The Mirage Plains: Vast, open plains within Sylara are often covered in mist. The plains are known for mirages—fleeting visions of forgotten places or people—which are said to lead travelers off course or reveal secrets hidden in the land.

#### Culture & Society

The Lakewardens: Sylara is inhabited by the Lakewardens, a reclusive but wise people who live in harmony with the ever-changing environment. They have a deep understanding of the enchanted lakes and serve as guides to those who seek safe passage through the region. The Lakewardens are skilled in water-based magic, allowing them to manipulate the flow of lakes and navigate the shifting landscape.

#### Mysteries & Legends

The Mirror King: Sylara’s greatest legend speaks of the Mirror King, an enigmatic figure who is said to reside within the deepest of the mirror lakes. It is said that he commands the movement of the lakes and the shifting of the land, and those who seek an audience must prove their worth by enduring the trials of the reflections—a series of visions that test one’s mind, heart, and soul.

#### Economy & Trade

Silverglass Crafting: The primary export of Sylara is "silverglass," a rare material harvested from the hardened surface of certain mirror lakes during specific celestial events. Silverglass is prized for its unique properties: it can bend light, deflect spells, and is used to craft elegant, durable armor and intricate jewelry.

Herbal Elixirs: The Glimmering Forest is home to many rare and magical plants, which the Lakewardens harvest to create potent elixirs and healing potions. These concoctions are highly sought after in the markets of Evergreen, particularly for their restorative and illusionary properties.

#### Points of Interest

The Shattered Tower: A ruin that protrudes from one of the largest mirror lakes, only visible during the full moon. The Shattered Tower is said to hold great secrets about the origin of Sylara’s magic, but accessing it is difficult, as the lake's surface turns solid and impenetrable on most nights.
