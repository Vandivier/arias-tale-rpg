## Chapter 1: The Obsidian Marshlands

In the murky, treacherous expanse of the Obsidian Marshlands, Ragnar Blackclaw, a master of stealth and assassination, leads his party into an ancient, decaying watchtower. The marsh, cloaked in a thick, sulfuric fog, is rumored as both the home of the Level 91 Floor Boss and also the magical source of hallucinations throughout the region. Searching for the source of the hallucinations, Ragnar and his diverse team of warriors, mages, and rangers navigate the dangers within the tower. Twisted black trees and knee-deep muck surround them, while faint whispers seem to beckon them further. Deep inside, they discover a hidden chamber bathed in a faint, pulsating glow. Crystals hum softly along the walls, channeling magic toward a glowing orb on a pedestal. Sensing immense magical power, the party hesitates to take direct action and instead records information, hoping to return with reinforcements from the nearby town of Gloomhaven.

After retreating safely from the tower, Ragnar's party encounters a band of weary adventurers on the outskirts of the marsh. They exchange information but choose not to ally immediately, preferring to continue on their path, but agreeing to meet up at Gloomhaven in the day or two that follow to discuss potential alliance. Reaching Gloomhaven, the party engages in a training session near the town's edge, sharpening their skills for future battles. Despite their thirst for a low-level skirmish, no creatures emerge, and the group returns to the safety of the town for rest, planning to consult experts in magical artifacts the following day.
