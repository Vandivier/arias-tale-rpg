## Chapter 1: The History of Solara

In its prime, the Time-Worn Empire, now known as Antiqua, was called the Empire of Solara. This grand empire was renowned for its advancements in various fields, including architecture, astrology, and magic. The Solarans, as the inhabitants were known, were a people deeply connected to the sun and celestial bodies, which influenced their culture, religion, and daily life. Their society was structured around the worship of the sun, which they believed was the source of all life and magic.

The Solarans were known for their skill in astronomy and astrology, using their knowledge of the stars and celestial events to guide their decisions and shape their understanding of the universe. They built massive observatories and temples dedicated to the sun, many of which now lie in ruins within Antiqua. Their architecture often featured sun motifs, and they were skilled in creating artifacts that harnessed solar energy.

The Solarans are considered the predecessors of several modern cultures in Evergreen. The knowledge and traditions of the Solarans have been passed down and adapted in various forms across different regions. Regalis was notably founded by Solarans. Aetheria and the Celestial Archipelago have substantial proportions of Solaran ancestry. It is also notable that virtually none of the modern inhabitants of Antiqua are Solaran. Some who claim Solaran descent and travel through the region complain of a unique illness, and some are never heard from again.

The causes of the downfall of Solara are a favorite topic of the scholars of Evergreen. The causes were manifold, touch on many of the national and royal stories of Evergreen, and are also not fully understood. Their empire was frequently involved in territorial despitutes and smaller wars going back to its founding. Interesting magical signatures and fields bearing some similarity to time magic are found in particular concentration around Antiqua. This curse on the former capital region seemed to cause a weakening in leadership combined with a mass exodus, and the further arms of the empire subsequently fell or reorganized into other nations over time.
