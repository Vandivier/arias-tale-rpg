    Taken from:
    - [Clarifying AI GM Instructions](https://chat.openai.com/c/4dff934f-3f8a-43d3-a213-7f72bf25ed64)
    - Angel Appearances: Bible Descriptions
    - Career Change: Nurse to Shop Owner
    - School Setting: Wealth & Size
    - Half-Beast Berserker Kaelira

    overall concept:
    - earliest to encounter the archmage is a full moon after the monstrous vision; then we could start playing school episodes
    - unlock conditions is when level 8 is cleared. aria's arc can meet these folks before then potentially but the letters and story won't be finished
        1. 14th floor is reached and no need for combat is discovered (latest)
        2. guild lunaria is discovered
        3. level 8 is cleared and no one knows how to progress further (olympia+aetheria=first heaven, the sky on 8, first dream ends on 9, second circle of hell is 12)
        4. time passes: the lunar gate is open each full moon. when caelum the younger and elder both attack
        5. (earliest) guild lunaria is discovered after the monstrous vision.
    - urban university, students rise from junior to college grad (vision happens while junior)
    - caelum the elder arrives the full moon after caelum the younger leaves (on a new moon)
    - caelum the elder helps guild lunaria prepare to ascend to the second heaven (the moon, where lunaria lives). he is quickly promoted to archmage and high priest
    - in the meantime, caelum mentors many young mages in the area including those at the school
    - the story is narrated as a series of scholarly letters or journal entries, many coming from the university professors and some coming from priests, nobels, and guild leaders. the scholars are frantically trying to collate world knowledge in an effort to defeat higher level bosses, survive, minimize deaths, and possibly even hack out of the game universe sooner than reaching the 100th floor boss if possible. many of the scholars are real-world researchers or technical folks of various kinds.
    - at the end, caelum the elder sacrifices himself to defeat lunaria, the 14th floor boss. we learn that his defeat of lunaria is a fulfillment of a prophet called ezekiel: "he that lives must die"
    - in aria's arc they discover these letters and journal entries at some point
    - the 6 monarchs of evergreen include:
        - a caliph
        - the monarch of triton
        - the beast king (bearking)
        - monarch of the dreamers
        - monarch of regalis
        - the dwarf monarch of new olympia
        - this, besides monarchs of the past and hell. there are also smaller regional nobles and warlords that might regard themselves as a king, but they don't hold a candle to these folks. for example, there are many royal dragons that might be considered effectively an absolute ruler over some small portion of dragonica, but not the whole region.
