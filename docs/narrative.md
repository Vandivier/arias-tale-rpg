### Chapter 1 Summary: The Monstrous Vision

One bright afternoon, a warrior takes a seat on a stump in a safe, shaded region of the Forest of Echoes. He carries a spear and shield across his back, while he carries a bag of freshly picked berries and walnuts in his hand. He tosses a berry into his mouth and reaches for a second when he hears a faint doorbell.

Mike realizes his pizza has arrived. He taps logout using his neural controller, but the button doesn't work. He tries again. Is there a bug in the game world of Evegreen?

Suddenly, the sky darkens with an orange glow. A massive, powerful figure appears in the sky. This figure confirms the inability of all players to log out unless and until a daunting challenge is completed: the 100th floor boss must be defeated.

The mysterious and monstrous figure warns of the extraordinary power of these floor bosses, advising players to form parties, guilds, and inter-guild alliances for survival. The figure notably enhances the strength of one monster on each floor, making them unbeatable by even the most powerful players alone.

### Chapter 2: Of Leaves, Town, and Squirrels

Eidolon reels in shock as the monster vanishes from the sky, taking the sick orange light with it. He wonders to himself, "What should I do?" It dawns on him that he can't remember what he was doing in the first place. In fact, he doesn't remember logging in at all.

"I need to find a town," he decides. That will be the best way to form a party and survive. Unfortunately, he has no clue where the nearest town is.

Exploring the forest, Eidolon encounters a plant monster. Revealing his agility and combat prowess, he deftly dodges and overcomes the creature. The final blow is dealt by an arrow shot empowered by the spiritual energy of his fae ancestors. Later, he reflects on the fact that he cannot remember logging in. Is he real, or merely a digital construct?

Aria, a charismatic spellcaster already within the Town of Echoes, immediately and succesfully seeks to rally local players into a guild of her own name. Within a day, Aria's Guild swells to about eighty members in a town of about three hundred residents.

Tank, the spearman played by Mike, shelters for a while in a safe portion of the forest then decides to return to the nearby Town of Echoes to seek a party. As Tank returns to town he encounters an enormous and territorial squirrel-like monster. While he is unable to defeat the squirrel, he eventually safely retreats toward the town.

Eidolon, seeking answers, scales a towering tree, glimpsing the serene Lake of Whispers, Tank in his tussle with the squirrel, and the distant town. Eidolon heads for the town, deftly avoiding a pack of wolves.

### Chapter 3: Preparation and Search

As Aria's Guild leads the search for the first floor boss, Tank seeks a guild to join. He finds a strong fit with The Shield Bearers, who welcome his membership contingent on passage of a trial of initiation.

In the course of the trial, Tank is violently cut in half by a powerful water and metal elemental. Elara, a priestess of light, a healer, and the leader of the guild, revives him the next day and congratulates him on his succesful demonstration of commitment.

The next day, the warriors seek and gain approval from Elara to take up a training expedition at The Lake of Whispers. As the group advanced along the verdant path to the lake, Tank learned a bit more about his new party.

Elara, the Healer-Leader, walked with an air of serene authority. Her stories, woven from the fabric of her distant village and her journey into the healing arts, floated around them like a gentle melody. Her leadership, firm yet suffused with empathy, painted her as the guild's guiding star.

Gavriel was always near her side, looming with few words. His simple and large robe, a curtain to his past, fluttered each step on contact with the upper portion of his plain tanned boots. His common attire did little to mask an aura of intense magical power, the kind of which was lost on Tank.

Lyra, an agile warrior, danced around the group as it proceeded, her twin swords catching glints of sunlight as she shared her tales of battle. Her laughter, light and spirited, broke through the group's focused march, injecting moments of levity.

Kael marched directly, embodying a veteran, stalwart, serious, and perhaps slightly annoyed counterpart to the frontline of the guild. He exuded a sense of unwavering loyalty and deference to Elara. The clink of his heavy armor punctuates his every word, a reminder of his dedication to guild and mission.

As they reached the lake, Gavriel's keen eyes fixed on a medium-sized lizardlike monster near the water's edge. "That one," he said, his voice low yet carrying an undertone of challenge. The group, with Tank at its heart, moved in swiftly but clumsily, utterly lacking organization or strategy.

Kael's voice, gruff with encouragement, broke the momentary silence. "I'll take it head-on!" With a decisive gesture, he led the charge towards the unsuspecting lizard.

The ensuing battle was a maelstrom of instinct. Lyra, the only contestant capable of graceful blade movement, struck first, and followed quickly, and again, so that a blur of silver seemed to appear before others had landed a single strike.

Kael followed, his strength channeled into a crushing blow from above. Gavriel's presence, though silent, hummed with latent power, his eyes aglow with the promise of unleashed magic.

As the lizard fought back, spraying a jet of water in defense, Elara stood like a beacon behind her companions. Her staff radiated healing light, weaving a protective tapestry around them.

The confrontation at the water's edge was a dance of elements - steel, water, and arcane energy. The lizard, realizing the futility against such formidable opponents, made a desperate dash for the safety of the lake.

But fate, or perhaps Gavriel's will, had other plans. With a mere gesture, a bolt of lightning arced from the mage's fingertips, striking the fleeing creature with unerring accuracy. The battle was over as swiftly as it had begun.

In the aftermath, the Shield Bearers stood united and momentarily cheerful. Then, on reflection, the frontline was briefly visited by embarassment before it turned into convicion for further training. Lyra set her swords on the ground and practiced with Tank's spear and shield for a bit. By the day's end, the Shield Bearers' signature Phalanx move had come to life, and Lyra had retired from her beloved swords for the foreseeable future.

As they returned towards the Town of Echoes, the world around them seemed to take a quiet breath. A cool mist followed from the lake to the edge of town, kissing their ankles with an acknowledgement of victory and whispering of the adventures that lay ahead.

Eidolon joins up with a different guild called The Elementalists. They perform a training mission at the Crossroads of the Elements, where they unexpectedly come upon a merchant being robbed. They defeat the robbers, but Johan, their fire mage, is fatally wounded during the battle. Eidolon notably recovers a magical earth crystal among other prizes. From a distance, Gavriel somehow senses the fall of Johan.

### Chapter 4: The Clash of Titans and Unification

The land trembles. From the Lake of Whispers, Tank spots a dark mushroom cloud erupt from the heart of the forest. Aria's Guild, it seems, has found the first floor boss.

The Shield Bearers approach the location carefully. Scorched trees, dark energy, and the sound of battle make the location obvious. They find the Dark Paladin locked in active combat with several guilds including Aria's Guild and the Crimson Vanguard.

At Tank's suggestion, the Shield Bearers set up a station on the outskirts of battle, collecting and treating the wounded to the best of their ability. They patch up many, several of whom are willing and able to return to battle. Perhaps most notable is Vaelor, a Dragonborn Paladin.

Vaelor was recovered like shrapnel as the sole survivor of a direct blast from the Dark Paladin. His wounds first appeared most grievous and he was clearly exhausted. While Elara began to work healing at the station, Vaelor took a moment of rest. After a moment, with his eyes still closed and his arm laid across his own chest, he struggled to hinge his hand upward. Healing energy slowly creeped out from his own hand, intersecting with and quickly catalyzing the work of Elara. Their spells seemed to ignite in a healing flash, and Vaelor was struck with vigor in the aftermath.

The air continued to crackle with dark energy as the Paladin unleashed blasts of shadow magic, tearing through the ranks of the brave combatants. The ground itself seemed to weep at the devastation wrought.

At an opportune moment, the Shield Bearers form a phalanx and rush in, bolstered by some of the wounded they have healed. Vaelor bore his shield at the side of , joining the signature formation as if he had used such a technique a thousand times before.

The Dark Paladin succumbs to a final blow, his figure shimmers in bright light and bright smoke seems to escape his armor, leaving a trail of magical energy.

The cost was grievous. Fifty-four brave souls from across four guilds fell that day, their sacrifice a somber echo in the hearts of the survivors. Among the dead were Briar, Kaelen, and Eryndor, three of the patched wounded that returned to battle as allies of the Shield Bearers. Many of the survivors felt relief at the end of battle, some collapsed from exhaustion, some burst into tears for their fallen allies, and many also felt the sting of guilt for their survival.

Overcome with guilt, a swordsman near the front line takes his own life. His body, blood, and tears fall near the damaged armor of the defeated Dark Paladin. After a brief moment, his blood and tears seemingly grow as a vine along the trail of energy left by the Dark Paladin. Then, seemingly under the weight of gravity, the trajectory arcs sharply down, running back into the ground. A dark purple light flashes under the blood vine and when the flash subsides an intricate purple doorway remains.

Counting the losses of his own guild, and impressed with the performance of the Shield Bearers, Vaelor revealed that is one of The Council of Three that leads a notable guild called The Crimson Vanguard. He invites the Shield Bearers to join forces with his guild. Elara and the others unanimously agree. This new alliance, born from the fires of battle, was a fusion of hope, strength, and determination for the journey ahead.

While occupied with discussion, Tank notices a few figures launch into the portal. "What in Evergreen are they doing?" he thinks. Many survivors gather into impromptu burial ceremonies. Soon Tank, his allies, and many others make for town.

### Chapter 5: The Gate Calls

After a day of rest, Thane calls for a training exercise for the newly restructured Crimson Vanguard. Thane, another of The Council of Three of the Crimson Vanguard, selects the Whispering Woods as a training location. The battle party departs northeast from town, making way quickly at first over a gravel trail, then departing the trail for grass to head due north to the woods, an east bank of the Lake of Whispers now to their left side.

The group pierces the treeline and their view is quickly shadowed. The group cautiously browses for a target, progressing deeper with nothing besides plants yet seen. As the group ventures deeper, the shadows turn darker as the canopy grows more dense. A humid warmth and a musty smell tickle Tank's nose. The tickle peristed a moment, seemed to vanish, then returned with a blinding burst of force across his head.

This new migraine brought with it a new vision. A vision of the Purple Gate adorned with black vines in the field of the recent traumatic victory swirl through his mind. This time, the gate was open and a hand reaches out, slowly at first, then accelerating with a grasping motion toward Tank. The vision is abruptly interrupted by a hazy view of the forest and blurred shouts. Figures like creepy men walk about lazily, and one figure darts like a cat. As Tank's vision cleares, he sees that battle has already begun. His allies express a range of emotion from fear and surprise to the readiness of pleased hunter in Thane.

The dark shapes are slowly clarified. Several ghouls swing empty fists with little skill. The panther-like Shadow Stalker is another story. The dark, predatory, territorial beast seems to match or even overwhelm Selena, an elegant and talented blade dancer.

Selena continues undeterred, and with good reason. Her allies steadily take down the ghouls one at a time, and she is increasinly supported in her assault of the powerful beast.

The battle proceeds as a dance of steel and magic. Selena's two blades whirl in a deadly ballet, cutting through the darkness. Besides the armored and skillful Thane, perhaps Ivar is the most notable. A half-orc bearkin, Ivar not only lacks but seemingly abhors the skillful use of blade and shield his allies practice. Ivar's roars matched the ferocity of his blows, each strike a testament to his barbarian might.

As steel meets shadow, the woods themselves seemed to hold their breath. Each parry, thrust, and incantation was a stroke in the grand tapestry of battle. The clash echoed through the woods, a symphony of conflict and survival.

In the end, the shadow was dispelled, the foes vanquished, but the questions lingered like the remnants of Tank's vision, hinting at a destiny intertwined with the mysteries of this digital world. The journey of The Crimson Vanguard had taken a turn into realms both wondrous and daunting, where each step forward was a step into the unknown.
