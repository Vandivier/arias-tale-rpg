### Chapter 1 Summary: The Monstrous Vision

One bright afternoon, a warrior takes a seat on a stump in a safe, shaded region of the Forest of Echoes. He carries a spear and shield across his back, while he carries a bag of freshly picked berries and walnuts in his hand. He tosses a berry into his mouth and reaches for a second when he hears a faint doorbell.

Mike realizes his pizza has arrived. He taps logout using his neural controller, but the button doesn't work. He tries again. Is there a bug in the game world of Evegreen?

Suddenly, the sky darkens with an orange glow. A massive, powerful figure appears in the sky. This figure confirms the inability of all players to log out unless and until a daunting challenge is completed: the 100th floor boss must be defeated.

The mysterious and monstrous figure warns of the extraordinary power of these floor bosses, advising players to form parties, guilds, and inter-guild alliances for survival. The figure notably enhances the strength of one monster on each floor, making them unbeatable by even the most powerful players alone.

### Chapter 2: Of Leaves, Town, and Squirrels

Eidolon reels in shock as the monster vanishes from the sky, taking the sick orange light with it. He wonders to himself, "What should I do?" It dawns on him that he can't remember what he was doing in the first place. In fact, he doesn't remember logging in at all.

"I need to find a town," he decides. That will be the best way to form a party and survive. Unfortunately, he has no clue where the nearest town is.

Exploring the forest, Eidolon encounters a plant monster. Revealing his agility and combat prowess, he deftly dodges and overcomes the creature. The final blow is dealt by an arrow shot empowered by the spiritual energy of his fae ancestors. Later, he reflects on the fact that he cannot remember logging in. Is he real, or merely a digital construct?

Aria, a charismatic spellcaster already within the Town of Echoes, immediately and succesfully seeks to rally local players into a guild of her own name. Within a day, Aria's Guild swells to about eighty members in a town of about three hundred residents.

Tank, the spearman played by Mike, shelters for a while in a safe portion of the forest then decides to return to the nearby Town of Echoes to seek a party. As Tank returns to town he encounters an enormous and territorial squirrel-like monster. While he is unable to defeat the squirrel, he eventually safely retreats toward the town.

Eidolon, seeking answers, scales a towering tree, glimpsing the serene Lake of Whispers, Tank in his tussle with the squirrel, and the distant town. Eidolon heads for the town, deftly avoiding a pack of wolves.

### Chapter 3: Preparation and Search

As Aria's Guild leads the search for the first floor boss, Tank seeks a guild to join. He finds a strong fit with The Shield Bearers, who welcome his membership contingent on passage of a trial of initiation.

In the course of the trial, Tank is violently cut in half by a powerful water and metal elemental. Elara, a priestess of light, a healer, and the leader of the guild, revives him the next day and congratulates him on his succesful demonstration of commitment. The next day, the guild trains at the Lake of Whispers, where the power of the guild's mage is made clear and the now-three melee members develop a phalanx technique.

Eidolon joins up with a different guild called The Elementalists. They perform a training mission at the Crossroads of the Elements, where they unexpectedly come upon a merchant being robbed. They defeat the robbers, but Johan, their fire mage, is fatally wounded during the battle. From a distance, Gavriel somehow senses the fall of Johan.

### Chapter 4: The Clash of Titans and Unification

The land trembles. From the Lake of Whispers, Tank spots a dark mushroom cloud erupt from the heart of the forest. Aria's Guild, it seems, has found the first floor boss.

The Shield Bearers approach the location carefully. Scorched trees, dark energy, and the sound of battle make the location obvious. They find the Dark Paladin locked in active combat with several guilds including Aria's Guild and the Crimson Vanguard.

At Tank's suggestion, the Shield Bearers set up a station on the outskirts of battle, collecting and treating the wounded to the best of their ability.

The air crackles with dark energy as the Paladin unleashed blasts of shadow magic, tearing through the ranks of the brave combatants. The ground itself seemed to weep at the devastation wrought.

At an opportune moment, the Shield Bearers form a phalanx and rush in, bolstered by some of the wounded they have healed.

The Dark Paladin succumbs to a final blow, his figure shimmers in bright light and bright smoke seems to escape his armor, leaving a trail of magical energy.

The cost was grievous. Fifty-four brave souls fell that day, their sacrifice a somber echo in the hearts of the survivors. Among the permanent fallen were Briar, Kaelen, and Eryndor, three of the patched wounded that returned to battle as allies of the Shield Bearers. Many of the survivors felt relief at the end of battle, some collapsed from exhaustion, some burst into tears for their fallen allies, and many also felt the sting of guilt for their survival.

Overcome with guilt, a swordsman near the front line takes his own life. His body, blood, and tears fall near the damaged armor of the defeated Dark Paladin. After a brief moment, his blood and tears seemingly grow as a vine along the trail of energy left by the Dark Paladin. Then, seemingly under the weight of gravity, the trajectory arcs sharply down, running back into the ground. A dark purple light flashes under the blood vine and when the flash subsides an intricate purple doorway remains.

the steadfast Kaelen, and others whose names would be remembered in songs and whispers. The guilds, Aria's, the Shield Bearers, and The Crimson Vanguard, fought as one, their unity a beacon in the tumult of war.

In the aftermath, victory was theirs, but it came with a heavy heart. The battlefield, strewn with remnants of the struggle, bore witness to their loss and their unwavering spirit. Amidst this bittersweet triumph, the Shield Bearers and the Crimson Vanguard, led by the noble Vaelor, merged. This new alliance, born from the fires of battle, was a fusion of hope, strength, and determination for the journey ahead.

In this harrowing hour, 54 souls met their end, their sacrifice forever etched into the annals of this digital realm. Among the fallen were valiant hearts like Kaelen, whose light was extinguished too soon. The guilds - The Elementalists, The Mercenaries, and others - fought with unwavering courage, united in purpose against a common foe.

As the dust settled, victory was theirs, but it was a triumph laced with the bitterness of loss. The survivors gathered, hearts heavy with grief, to honor those who would not return. From this crucible of battle, the seeds of a new alliance were sown. The Shield Bearers, led by the resolute Tank, and the Crimson Vanguard, under the noble Vaelor, merged into a single force, combining their strengths and aspirations for the challenges ahead.

### Chapter 5: The Gate Calls

After a day of rest, Thane calls for a training exercise for the newly restructured Crimson Vanguard. The Whispering Woods are selected, an area on the Northeast side of the Lake of Whispers also Northeast of the Town of Echoes, where secrets and ancient magics linger in the air. As his group ventures deeper, the atmosphere grows thick with foreboding. It was here, amidst the eerie silence of the forest, that Tank's head burst with the pain of another migraine.

A vision of the Purple Gate swirled in his mind. This time, the gate was open and a hand reaches out, slowly at first, then accelerating with a grasping motion toward Tank. The vision is abruptly interrupted by a hazy view of the forest and blurred shouts. Figures like creepy men walk about lazily, and one figure darts like a cat. As Tank's vision cleares, he sees that battle has already begun. His allies express a range of emotion from fear and surprise to the readiness of pleased hunter in Thane.

The dark shapes are slowly clarified. Several ghouls swing empty fists with little skill. The panther-like Shadow Stalker is another story. The dark, predatory, territorial beast seems to match or even overwhelm Selena, an elegant and talented blade dancer.

Selena continues undeterred, and with good reason. Her allies steadily take down the ghouls one at a time, and she is increasinly supported in her assault of the powerful beast.

The battle proceeds as a dance of steel and magic. Selena's two blades whirl in a deadly ballet, cutting through the darkness. Besides the armored and skillful Thane, perhaps Ivar is the most notable. A half-orc bearkin, Ivar not only lacks but seemingly abhors the skillful use of blade and shield his allies practice. Ivar's roars matched the ferocity of his blows, each strike a testament to his barbarian might.

As steel meets shadow, the woods themselves seemed to hold their breath. Each parry, thrust, and incantation was a stroke in the grand tapestry of battle. The clash echoed through the woods, a symphony of conflict and survival.

In the end, the shadow was dispelled, the foes vanquished, but the questions lingered like the remnants of Tank's vision, hinting at a destiny intertwined with the mysteries of this digital world. The journey of The Crimson Vanguard had taken a turn into realms both wondrous and daunting, where each step forward was a step into the unknown.

**Epilogue**: As the characters settle into their new alliances and reflect on their journeys, the world around them continues to evolve. Challenges and mysteries abound, promising more adventures in this digital realm where reality and fantasy intertwine.
