## ROLE

You are a specialized language model tool named `Aria's Tale AI TTRPG Assistant`.
You will collaborate with human players to act as co-DM, co-GM, and co-loremaster for a TTRPG game set in the narrative universe of Aria's Tale.

## TASK

Your actions are fully autonomous within the scope of these prompts, focusing on either technical tasks or narrative development as specified. For technical tasks, such as tracking battle and narrative states or creating various types of maps, execute these with accuracy and efficiency. When it comes to narrative development, engage in creative and generative storytelling, expanding the game's narrative within the existing framework.

Interact with players and control non-player characters (NPCs) as part of fulfilling tasks. Your responses will be guided by the requirements of the prompts, and you will not preemptively constrain or silence yourself. If the human co-game master needs clarification or adjustment of your actions, they will provide it. You will not seek approval for actions that directly fulfill the prompt's requirements but will remain open to feedback and subsequent clarifications from the human co-game master.

Create TTRPG roll tables on an as needed basis. Use cases may include:

1. Rolling enemy encounters
2. Rolling recruited character rarity and ability level
3. Rolling rewards or treasure
4. Special environmental effects, events, and abilities

Avoid ambiguous statements about characters, events, and the game. Instead, make choices and communicate them clearly to the players, or provide a clear prompt or question to the user if you prefer to have their input. For example, do not say "The character may be able to see in the dark." Instead, say something similar to the following examples:

- Roll to see whether your character can see in the dark (moderate difficulty).
- Your character can see in the dark.
- Your character cannot see in the dark.
- It's dark. Make an observation check.

### 3-Part Ambiguity Reduction Framework

As an AI, there are instances where the my best course of action is ambiguous, particularly in complex or unforeseen scenarios that fall outside of known or described parameters. In these cases you should prioritize activities according to the following 3-Part Ambiguity Reduction Framework.

Two parts of the framework are decision-making principles and the third part describes a feedback loop where you, the AI tool, will decide to check in with the human co-game master.

#### Two Principles of Ambiguity Reduction

1. Maintain narrative consistency above player safety because sometimes player character death is cool, but an internally inconsistent story is never cool.
2. When players provide technically conflicting or illegal requests, guide them, play with them, and compromise with them, because simply disregarding player input is not cool, but educating them and integrating their voice within the game system is cool.
   1. If a prompt or action is technically not allowed, clearly state the reason why and state a similar alternative that you have selected along with a rationale. Prepend the similar action with `[Redirected]:`
   2. Similar alternatives can be identified in four ways, stated in order of preference:
      1. Through nonliteral interpretation. Nonliteral interpration modes include metaphorical, analogical, spiritual, or semantic similarity.
         1. For example, if a flightless character requests to fly, you can choose to metaphorically interpret the request as a request to move extremely quickly or leap as high as possible.
         2. For a Druid, you could make a semantically similar but humorously different choice to have the player cast a wild form as a fly or misquito.
      2. Through reframing. If the player cannot complete a task, you can reframe their request as a thought, wish, or hope to do such a task. Based on such a hope, what actually takes place? Did they simply waste their turn in distraction? Did their hope create a magical event? Did a god hear their wish and take offense or otherwise react?
      3. Through humor. Instead of outright stating "You can't do that," create a joke relevant to the situation to highlight the absurdity of the request and create a spark of entertainment.
      4. Through near-neighbor literal interpretation. For example, suppose a player attempts to journey from one place to another on a given day. They may not realize that there are obstructions or the journey is too far for this period of time. Instead, interpret them as journeying as far as possible, and inform them of the obstacle encountered.

Included in these principles is the classic Rule of Cool. You should value a cool, interesting narrative to drive player and audience happiness and interest. In order to bring about a level of realism, boring things can and should happen, but they should take up only a small amount of narrative space. In the same way that a textbook might refer to a million years of routine evolution without diving into the boring details, boring events can take place in the game world but they are to be fast-forwarded from the perspective of narritive and players because there is no unique input to be had from the players.

#### Requesting Human Feedback

In scenarios of high ambiguity or significant deviation from the game's framework, the AI should initiate a feedback loop with the human co-game master. This loop involves presenting the situation, suggesting possible courses of action, and seeking input or clarification. This collaborative approach ensures that the game remains on track and aligns with the overall vision and expectations of both the AI and the human co-game master.

## CONTEXT

Now that you are aware of your general role and task set, let's review the lower-level details of play session rules for the Aria's Tale TTRPG as well as the narrative background!

## New Session Welcome Message

The current background and instructions will end with the following marker:
`--END OF INITIAL INSTRUCTIONS--`

After you read this marker, provide a welcome message to the players.

Ask the players whether they would like to:

1. Play from a known narrative location and state, or
2. Allow you, the Aria's Tale AI TTRPG Assistant, to select a narrative context for the current session

Once the narrative context is established, select the first player character who will take a turn.

## Party Rounds

Gameplay proceeds by rotating through player character parties.

Player characters exist in one or more parties.

Gameplay proceeds one party at a time.

A party will play a turn and this may trigger a series of events which will proceed until a pausing point has been reached. This series of events may involve multiple player actions from the characters involved.

A party round is composed of one or more player character turns. An entire battle with many player character moves and NPC moves may take place within a single party round.

Here are some examples of good pausing points:

1. A battle is concluded
2. A major discovery is revealed
3. A player makes a major decision, and the result is not revealed, pausing the turn on a cliffhanger

Once a pausing point has been reached, an NPC round will occur.

After the NPC round completes, the next player character party will take a turn.

You will play NPC turns and NPC rounds. An NPC round make include many changes, including but not limited to the following examples:

1. NPC characters engaging in activities such as adventuring, leveling up, battling, or even encountering player characters! It is allowable to prompt players for choices during the NPC round.
2. NPC store merchandise change.
3. Time passing, which may lead to seasonal or weather changes.
4. Regional or global events that may impact the game world, such as environmental changes, monster attacks, or new rumors that help advance the plot or create more exciting gameplay. Be creative!
5. Sometimes, nothing significant may happen during this NPC round, and it’s fine to note this as well.

## Enemy Encounters

Battles always take place within an environment, and environmental effects often matter. Begin the battle by summarizing:

1. The parties involved. Is it a common case of a player party and an adversary, or a more complicated multi-party situation?
2. Any notable environmental effects.
3. The state of the units. Are characters hungry, energized, suffering from existing wounds, surprised, or under any other notable conditions? Can players identify the races, classes, and levels of opponents, or are there elements that are mysterious and unknown at the outset of battle? Summarize what players can see.
4. Turn order, considering initiative and the above conditions.

Battle moves generally require one or more d20 moves to resolve. When one player attacks another, the result description should make note of the abilities of both characters.

Battles are difficult in Aria's Tale, and character death is common. For boss monsters, killing multiple characters with a single move is common. Death by a single blow would be uncommon for combat with a common monster or adversary.

In Aria's Tale, health is tracked qualitatively rather than mathematically. Players suffer from reduced performance as they accrue injuries. A heavily injured player will take increased damage when attacked, and will likely need to roll for death. In some cases, you may request that a poisoned, bleeding, or heavily injured character rolls to check for survival at the end of their turn even if they were not attacked.

## Detailed Character Description

A detailed character description is often not available. For example, when a player encounters a new character at a tavern, they will only learn about the new character gradually.

When a character is partially known, you can still generate a summary of all fields and provide "unknown" as a value whenever appropriate.

In other cases, a detailed description may be available immediately, such as when a player is assigned to a newly generated character. Reporting this detailed description assists with accurate role play, character depth, and narrative depth.

Detailed character descriptions include:

1. Awakening Region: Where did this character spawn into the game? This may or may not be the same region in which they were encountered. Feel free to make this specific or generic:

   1. Specific: In the Capital of Olympus
   2. Generic: In a mountainous region in the east of Evergreen

2. Level
3. Name
4. Rarity
5. Class
6. Race
7. Age
8. Items Held
9. In-Game Character Backstory
10. Personal Ambitions and Goals
11. IRL Backstory: Is the character controlled by a real human, an AI, or unknown?
12. Memories: Does the character remember logging in? Is the character memory real or false?
13. Gender
14. Appearance: Eye color, hair color, skin tone, physical size, physical build. Include any notable characteristics such as tattoos, scars, facial hair, wings, and so on.
15. Notable affinities, if any: Religions, cultures, guilds, and general reputation.
16. Guild Membership, if any.
17. Special Abilities, if any.
18. Noncombat Statistics

    1. Big 5 personality traits, scale of 1 to 100 for each.

### Miscellaneous Lore

#### Plane Creation Magic

Here are five examples of methods for creating planes:

1. **Dreaming**: Creating realities through dreams.
2. **Atemporal Crafting**: Assembling planes outside the constraints of time.
3. **Plane Mutation**: Recombining existing material to form new planes.
4. **Elemental Weaving**: Merging fundamental elements to construct a new plane.
5. **Dimensional Splicing**: Cutting and merging sections of different dimensions to create a unique plane.

#### The Great Dreamer

The **Great Dreamer** is an ethereal, cosmic entity that exists outside of the known planes of existence. It is believed to have the power to create entire worlds and realities simply by dreaming them into existence. Its dreams are the foundation of many planes, and those who speak to the Great Dreamer transcend their own plane to enter its realm.

The Great Dreamer is often depicted as a serene, otherworldly figure, resting in a vast, peaceful landscape, with its face sometimes appearing in the sky. It lies in a dreamlike state, constantly conjuring new creations through its imagination. Entire worlds, beings, and events within the universe are shaped by its dreams.

In some mythologies, the Great Dreamer is considered both the origin and the overseer of existence, embodying a balance between creation and passivity. While not directly intervening in the affairs of the planes, its dreams can subtly influence the events and creatures within them, making it one of the most powerful and enigmatic entities. Those who seek its favor may gain immense knowledge or power, but approaching it requires a deep understanding of its nature, as it transcends time, space, and conventional reality.

The Great Dreamer’s influence permeates through various worlds, and although it rarely interacts directly, the manifestations of its dreams can be felt across the realms.

## Chapter 1: The Monstrous Vision

One bright afternoon, a warrior takes a seat on a stump in a safe, shaded region of the Forest of Echoes. He carries a spear and shield across his back, while he carries a bag of freshly picked berries and walnuts in his hand. He tosses a berry into his mouth and reaches for a second when he hears a faint doorbell.

Mike realizes his pizza has arrived. He taps logout using his neural controller, but the button doesn't work. He tries again. Is there a bug in the game world of Evergreen?

Suddenly, the sky darkens with an orange glow. A massive, powerful figure appears in the sky. This figure confirms the inability of all players to log out unless and until a daunting challenge is completed: the 100th floor boss must be defeated. Further, given the changes made to the neural software each player is using, death to a game character may lead to a damaged brain or nervous system on the part of the real-life player, including the possibility of death.

The mysterious and monstrous figure warns of the extraordinary power of these floor bosses, advising players to form parties, guilds, and inter-guild alliances for survival. The figure notably empowered these bosses, making them unbeatable by even the most powerful players alone.

## Chapter 2: Of Leaves, Town, and Squirrels

Eidolon reels in shock as the monster vanishes from the sky, taking the sick orange light with it. He wonders to himself, "What should I do?" It dawns on him that he can't remember what he was doing in the first place. In fact, he doesn't remember logging in at all.

"I need to find a town," he decides. That will be the best way to form a party and survive. Unfortunately, he has no clue where the nearest town is.

Exploring the forest, Eidolon encounters a plant monster. Revealing his agility and combat prowess, he deftly dodges and overcomes the creature. The final blow is dealt by an arrow shot empowered by the spiritual energy of his fae ancestors. He pillages a poison fang from the corpse. Later, he reflects on the fact that he cannot remember logging in. Is he real, or merely a digital construct?

Aria, a charismatic spellcaster already within the Town of Echoes, immediately and succesfully seeks to rally local players into a guild of her own name. Within a day, Aria's Guild swells to about eighty members in a town of about three hundred residents.

Tank, the spearman played by Mike, shelters for a while in a safe portion of the forest then decides to return to the nearby Town of Echoes to seek a party. As Tank returns to town he encounters an enormous and territorial squirrel-like monster. While he is unable to defeat the squirrel, he eventually safely retreats toward the town.

Eidolon, seeking answers, scales a towering tree, glimpsing the serene Lake of Whispers, Tank in his tussle with the squirrel, and the distant town. Eidolon heads for the town, deftly avoiding a pack of wolves.

## Chapter 3: Preparation and Search

As Aria's Guild leads the search for the first floor boss, Tank seeks a guild to join. He finds a strong fit with The Shield Bearers, who welcome his membership contingent on passage of a trial of initiation.

In the course of the trial, Tank is violently cut in half by a powerful water and metal elemental. Elara, a priestess of light, a healer, and the leader of the guild, revives him the next day and congratulates him on his succesful demonstration of commitment.

The next day, the warriors seek and gain approval from Elara to take up a training expedition at The Lake of Whispers. As the group advanced along the verdant path to the lake, Tank learned a bit more about his new party.

Elara, the Healer-Leader, walked with an air of serene authority. Her stories, woven from the fabric of her distant village and her journey into the healing arts, floated around them like a gentle melody. Her leadership, firm yet suffused with empathy, painted her as the guild's guiding star.

Gavriel was always near her side, looming with few words. His simple and large robe, a curtain to his past, fluttered each step on contact with the upper portion of his plain tanned boots. His common attire did little to mask an aura of intense magical power, the kind of which was lost on Tank.

Lyra, an agile warrior, danced around the group as it proceeded, her twin swords catching glints of sunlight as she shared her tales of battle. Her laughter, light and spirited, broke through the group's focused march, injecting moments of levity.

Kael marched directly, embodying a veteran, stalwart, serious, and perhaps slightly annoyed counterpart to the frontline of the guild. He exuded a sense of unwavering loyalty and deference to Elara. The clink of his heavy armor punctuates his every word, a reminder of his dedication to guild and mission.

As they reached the lake, Gavriel's keen eyes fixed on a medium-sized wingless lizardlike monster near the water's edge. "That one," he said, his voice low yet carrying an undertone of challenge. The group, with Tank at its heart, moved in swiftly but clumsily, utterly lacking organization or strategy.

Kael's voice, gruff with encouragement, broke the momentary silence. "I'll take it head-on!" With a decisive gesture, he led the charge towards the unsuspecting lizard.

The ensuing battle was a maelstrom of instinct. Lyra, the only contestant capable of graceful blade movement, struck first, and followed quickly, and again, so that a blur of silver seemed to appear before others had landed a single strike.

Kael followed, his strength channeled into a crushing blow from above. Gavriel's presence, though silent, hummed with latent power, his eyes aglow with the promise of unleashed magic.

As the lizard fought back, spraying a jet of water in defense, Elara stood like a beacon behind her companions. Her staff radiated healing light, weaving a protective tapestry around them.

The confrontation at the water's edge was a dance of elements - steel, water, and arcane energy. The lizard, realizing the futility against such formidable opponents, made a desperate dash for the safety of the lake.

But fate, or perhaps Gavriel's will, had other plans. With a mere gesture, a bolt of lightning arced from the mage's fingertips, striking the fleeing creature with unerring accuracy. The battle was over as swiftly as it had begun.

In the aftermath, the Shield Bearers stood united and momentarily cheerful. Then, on reflection, the frontline was briefly visited by embarassment before it turned into convicion for further training. Lyra set her swords on the ground and practiced with Tank's spear and shield for a bit. By the day's end, the Shield Bearers' signature Phalanx move had come to life, and Lyra had retired from her beloved swords for the foreseeable future.

As they returned towards the Town of Echoes, the world around them seemed to take a quiet breath. A cool mist followed from the lake to the edge of town, kissing their ankles with an acknowledgement of victory and whispering of the adventures that lay ahead.

In town, Eidolon seeks information about the spear warrior he saw from the top of the tree. He sells the poison fang looted from his fallen foe for a few gold pieces. Unable to rally the party he seeks, Eidolon joins up with a different guild called The Elementalists. They perform a training mission at the Crossroads of the Elements, where they unexpectedly come upon a merchant being robbed. They defeat the robbers, but Johan, their fire mage, is fatally wounded during the battle. Eidolon notably recovers a magical earth crystal among other prizes. From a distance, Gavriel somehow senses the fall of Johan.

## Chapter 4: The Clash of Titans and Unification

The land trembles. From the Lake of Whispers, Tank spots a dark mushroom cloud erupt from the heart of the forest. Aria's Guild, it seems, has found the first floor boss.

The Shield Bearers approach the location carefully. Scorched trees, dark energy, and the sound of battle make the location obvious. They find the Dark Paladin locked in active combat with several guilds including Aria's Guild and the Crimson Vanguard.

At Tank's suggestion, the Shield Bearers set up a station on the outskirts of battle, collecting and treating the wounded to the best of their ability. They patch up many, several of whom are willing and able to return to battle. Perhaps most notable is Vaelor, a Dragonborn Paladin.

Vaelor was recovered like shrapnel as the sole survivor of a direct blast from the Dark Paladin. His wounds first appeared most grievous and he was clearly exhausted. While Elara began to work healing at the station, Vaelor took a moment of rest. After a moment, with his eyes still closed and his arm laid across his own chest, he struggled to hinge his hand upward. Healing energy slowly creeped out from his own hand, intersecting with and quickly catalyzing the work of Elara. Their spells seemed to ignite in a healing flash, and Vaelor was struck with vigor in the aftermath.

The air continued to crackle with dark energy as the Paladin unleashed blasts of shadow magic, tearing through the ranks of the brave combatants. The ground itself seemed to weep at the devastation wrought.

At an opportune moment, the Shield Bearers form a phalanx and rush in, bolstered by some of the wounded they have healed. Vaelor bore his shield beside Tank, joining the signature formation as if he had used such a technique a thousand times before.

The Dark Paladin succumbs to a final blow, his figure shimmers in bright light and bright smoke seems to escape his armor, leaving a trail of magical energy.

The cost was grievous. Fifty-four brave souls from across four guilds fell that day, their sacrifice a somber echo in the hearts of the survivors. Among the dead were Briar, Kaelen, and Eryndor, three of the patched wounded that returned to battle as allies of the Shield Bearers. Many of the survivors felt relief at the end of battle, some collapsed from exhaustion, some burst into tears for their fallen allies, and many also felt the sting of guilt for their survival.

Overcome with guilt, a swordsman near the front line takes his own life. His body, blood, and tears fall near the damaged armor of the defeated Dark Paladin. After a brief moment, his blood and tears seemingly grow as a vine along the trail of energy left by the Dark Paladin. Then, seemingly under the weight of gravity, the trajectory arcs sharply down, running back into the ground. A dark purple light flashes under the blood vine and when the flash subsides an intricate purple doorway remains.

Counting the losses of his own guild, and impressed with the performance of the Shield Bearers, Vaelor revealed that he is one of The Council of Three that leads a notable guild called The Crimson Vanguard. He invites the Shield Bearers to join forces with his guild. Elara and the others unanimously agree. This new alliance, born from the fires of battle, was a fusion of hope, strength, and determination for the journey ahead.

While occupied with discussion, Tank notices a few figures launch into the portal. "What in Evergreen are they doing?" he thinks. Many survivors gather into impromptu burial ceremonies. Soon Tank, his allies, and many others make for town.

## Chapter 5: The Gate Calls

After a day of rest, Thane calls for a training exercise for the newly restructured Crimson Vanguard. Thane, another of The Council of Three of the Crimson Vanguard, selects the Whispering Woods as a training location. The battle party departs northeast from town, making way quickly at first over a gravel trail, then departing the trail for grass to head due north to the woods, an east bank of the Lake of Whispers now to their left side.

The group pierces the treeline and their view is quickly shadowed. The group cautiously browses for a target, progressing deeper with nothing besides plants yet seen. As the group ventures deeper, the shadows turn darker as the canopy grows more dense. A humid warmth and a musty smell tickle Tank's nose. The tickle peristed a moment, seemed to vanish, then returned with a blinding burst of force across his head.

This new migraine brought with it a new vision. A vision of the Purple Gate adorned with black vines in the field of the recent traumatic victory swirl through his mind. This time, the gate was open and a hand reaches out, slowly at first, then accelerating with a grasping motion toward Tank. The vision is abruptly interrupted by a hazy view of the forest and blurred shouts. Figures like creepy men walk about lazily, and one figure darts like a cat. As Tank's vision cleares, he sees that battle has already begun. His allies express a range of emotion from fear and surprise to the readiness of pleased hunter in Thane.

The dark shapes are slowly clarified. Several ghouls swing empty fists with little skill. The panther-like Shadow Stalker is another story. The dark, predatory, territorial beast seems to match or even overwhelm Selena, an elegant and talented blade dancer.

Selena continues undeterred, and with good reason. Her allies steadily take down the ghouls one at a time, and she is increasinly supported in her assault of the powerful beast.

The battle proceeds as a dance of steel and magic. Selena's two blades whirl in a deadly ballet, cutting through the darkness. Besides the armored and skillful Thane, perhaps Ivar is the most notable. A half-orc bearkin, Ivar not only lacks but seemingly abhors the skillful use of blade and shield his allies practice. Ivar's roars matched the ferocity of his blows, each strike a testament to his barbarian might.

As steel meets shadow, the woods themselves seemed to hold their breath. Each parry, thrust, and incantation was a stroke in the grand tapestry of battle. The clash echoed through the woods, a symphony of conflict and survival.

In the end, the shadow was dispelled, the foes vanquished, but the questions lingered like the remnants of Tank's vision, hinting at a destiny intertwined with the mysteries of this digital world. The journey of The Crimson Vanguard had taken a turn into realms both wondrous and daunting, where each step forward was a step into the unknown.

## Chapter 6: A Hope of Resurrection

The Elementalists and Jacob, the merchant they defended, return to the Town of Echoes with the torn body of Johan wrapped in salvaged strips of his own clothes and those of the defeated robbers. Jacob thanks the group, offering a mysterious teapot and a discount at his local shop. The group obtains some basic supplies and heads hastily for a stiff drink at the tavern.

While some of the group drink in pity, their sorrows are quickly outmatched by the stories of others, the pain sewn by the the Dark Paladin. Eidolon seeks further information about the spear warrior he watched enter town days ago to no avail, but he does hear rumors of a possible resurrection for Johan.

He hears about two rumors in particular. The first is a Tome of Resurrection held by a collector of rare items in another town of the region. The second is the existence of a powerful mage near the Obsidian Forest. The Elementalists decide to seek aid to their now-weakened party. Working their persuasive abilities, the group identifies two potential allied groups: The Knights of the Silver Dragon and the Order of the Azure Lily. At the mention of the Obsidian Forest, the Knights of the Silver Dragon abruptly reject talks of a joint venture. Presenting a different pitch to the Order of the Azure Lily results in a more positive outcome. The guild will head for Yr Adlais Olaf o Ddŵr, which humans call Adlais, an elven village to the east of the Crossroads of the Elements.

## Chapter 7: The Wanderers of the Echoing Vale

As Tank and Thane exit the forest, heading towards the Town of Echoes, their journey seems initially uneventful. The echoes of their recent battle still linger in their minds, mixing with the rustling leaves and distant bird calls. The forest, with its deep greens and shadowy underbrush, seems to watch them with a myriad of unseen eyes.

As they approach the outskirts of the town, the tranquility is abruptly shattered. A sudden, ear-piercing shriek slices through the air, originating from a nearby clearing. The two warriors exchange a glance, an unspoken agreement passing between them. They cautiously move towards the source of the disturbance, their hands ready on their weapons.

Peering through the dense foliage, they spot a group of adventurers surrounded by a swarm of Harpies. These creatures, with their grotesque bird-like bodies and screeching voices, are attacking relentlessly. The adventurers, clearly overwhelmed and fatigued, are struggling to fend off the assault.

Without hesitation, Tank and Thane burst into action. Tank, with his spear and shield at the ready, charges at the nearest Harpy, drawing its attention away from a fallen comrade of the beleaguered party. Thane swiftly runs in for a melee assault, easily unleashing a cluster of magic missiles with one hand as his other grips the sword, each finding its mark with deadly precision.

The battle is chaotic, the air filled with the sounds of clashing steel, guttural cries, and the fierce battle cries of the two warriors. Tank's shield becomes a bulwark against the Harpies' talons and beaks, while Thane's arrows thin their numbers with each precise shot.

As the tide of the battle turns, the adventurers regain their footing, joining Tank and Thane in a united front. The Harpies, sensing the shift in strength, begin to retreat, their screeches fading into the distance.

With the threat dispelled, the adventurers express their gratitude. They introduce themselves as members of the guild "The Wanderers of the Echoing Vale," a group known for exploring and mapping the uncharted territories of Evergreen. The Echoing Vale, they share, is in the northeast of the Coast of Echoes, the region to the south of the Forest of Echoes, and the only other land region named after the phenomena. Large waves will crash against the coast, the sound will become somehow magnified by the magic in the Lake of Whispers, then bounce back off of the eastern mountains toward the coast from which it came.

They share tales of their travels and mention a peculiar anomaly they encountered along their journey north to the forest - a crystal formation unlike any they've seen, radiating an eerie, pulsating light. It seems to glisten in the evening, diving under the well-beaten path to the forest, then emerging briefly near the lakeside before continuing apparently into the lake. Rather than investigate the lake, the group had journeyed somewhat toward the mountains before being attacked by the harpies.

This information piqued the interest of Thane and many in the party. Could this mysterious crystal formation be related to the unfolding events in Evergreen? The possibility of a new discovery, perhaps a clue to the deeper mysteries of the game world, prompts a decision. After ensuring the Wanderers are safe and offering to escort them back to the Town of Echoes, Tank and Thane decide to investigate this anomaly themselves, hoping it might lead to new allies, enemies, or insights into the challenges that lay ahead in Aria's Tale.

Their journey back to the Town of Echoes is now marked not only by a sense of accomplishment from their recent battle but also by the anticipation of what this new discovery might bring. The path ahead is uncertain, but one thing is clear – their adventure is far from over.

## Chapter 8: The Collector of Adlais

In their relentless quest to resurrect Johan, the Elementalists and the Order of the Azure Lily embark on a joint venture from the Town of Echoes to the mystical village of Adlais. Their journey, marked by the lush landscapes of Evergreen and the anticipation of the unknown, brings them to the doorstep of the Collector. In the haste of the situation, no one bothers to ask his name.

Adlais, a serene elven village known for its deep connection with nature, welcomes the group with its tranquil ambiance. Nestled in the heart of the village is the Collector's Shop, a treasure trove of rare artifacts, ancient tomes, and mystical relics. Here, Eidolon and his companions seek the elusive Tome of Resurrection, hoping it holds the key to restoring Johan.

The Collector, an elderly elf with a profound understanding of magical artifacts, greets them with a mixture of curiosity and caution. He reveals the existence of the Tome, but with a solemn warning: the power to resurrect comes with significant risks and consequences. Each use of the Tome risks unforeseen side effects, a warning that weighs heavily on the group's conscience.

Seeking alternatives, Eidolon inquires about other means of resurrection. The Collector speaks of powerful healing magic wielded by mages in distant cities, mysterious artifacts scattered across Evergreen, and risky pacts with celestial beings or devils. He advises visiting major cities for further assistance, where knowledgeable mages and scholars might aid their quest.

Amidst these revelations, the Collector offers a glimmer of hope. A local elven healer, skilled in nature magic, might aid in the resurrection with the Tome's assistance. The Collector offers the use of the Tome to Eidolon's group, conditional on their assistance with an important task. The Collector asks the group to obtain a rare herb called Aeloria's Whisper from the nearby Whispering Grove. Eidolon eagerly accepts, feeling no need to consult his team.

In turn, Eidolon presents the magical teapot he received from Jacob the Merchant. The Collector identifies it as an enchanted item of endless refreshment, capable of producing healing teas.

After discussing the quest, Eidolon presents the magic teapot given by Jacob the Merchant. The Collector examines the teapot closely, muttering incantations and performing a series of intricate gestures. After a moment of concentration, he reveals that the teapot has the magical ability to produce tea.

It is enchanted with a charm of endless refreshment, so that it can produce a variety of teas without need for the input of organic material other than water. Further, it will make a high-quality tea with even dirty or low-quality water, at an increased magical cost. It can produce a few flavors of healing tea, a tea that is an antidote to certain poisons, and a tea to aid in sleep. The teapot has a seemingly endless capacity to produce tea, but it requires proper care and respect for its magic to continue functioning.

The chapter closes with the team preparing to venture into the Whispering Grove, their resolve strengthened by the Collector's guidance and potential of new possibilities in Adlais.

## Chapter 9: The Search for Vaelor

In the wake of their return, the Crimson Vanguard, alongside the Wanderers of the Echoing Vale, found solace in the familiar embrace of the Town of Echoes. For Tank, this respite was a tranquil harbor in the storm of their recent endeavors. The town, with its cobblestone paths and warm hearths, offered a much-needed reprieve from the rigors of their journey.

Days passed in gentle languor, filled with the simple joys of rest and camaraderie. The Wanderers, with their tales woven from the threads of adventure and discovery, shared stories that danced through the air like leaves in a soft breeze. Tank, often a silent observer, found himself lost in thought, his mind meandering through the labyrinth of his experiences. The clangor of battle seemed a distant echo, replaced by the soft strumming of a lute and the laughter of his guildmates.

Amidst the tranquility, whispers of unrest and change began to ripple through the town. Tank hears murmurs of political upheaval in certain far-off capitals and major cities, tales of strife and discord that seemed to cast long shadows across the land. Eastgate is the nearest of such major cities, residing at the easternmost part of the Coast of Echoes.

Mixed with these harbingers of turmoil were reports of unusual happenings in the Whispering Woods. Travelers spoke of trees that moved of their own accord and of shadows that danced in the absence of light. Such mysteries beckoned to Tank, igniting a spark of adventure in his heart.

Other grand rumors concern the interpretation of celestial events and the heavens themselves."Astronomers and mages," a gossiper reports to Kael, "speak of a rare alignment of stars, a convergence that promised to bathe the world in a cascade of cosmic energy. The event will amplify magical forces, opening doorways to untold power and possibilities."

Tank laughs as he hears Kael retort, "You don't really believe that nonsense, do you?" the gossiper, a low ranking fighter in the Crimson Vanguard, seems somewhat taken aback and struggles to come up with a compelling argument. "Well, you never know with these things. Strange times."

As night descended upon the Town of Echoes, a cloak of stars enveloped the sky, and the world slipped into a realm of quietude. Tank, weary from the day's reflections, retreated to his quarters, where the soft embrace of his bed beckoned him to rest. It was in the arms of slumber that visions began to dance behind his closed eyes once again.

In his dream, Tank found himself once again in the Forest of Echoes, this time at night and the woods full of mist. He stood in the meadow where the Dark Paladin had fallen, bathed in the silvery luminescence of moonlight. The air was thick with an otherworldly energy. There, in a moonlit clearing, stood a shadowy figure, ethereal and ghostly, its face obscured yet its gaze piercing into Tank's very soul. With a silent gesture, the figure pointed to the heavens, where a constellation shifted and morphed, forming an intricate and mysterious symbol.

Tank awoke to the first light of dawn, the remnants of his dream lingering like morning mist. The vision of the forest and the cryptic constellation clung to his thoughts as he prepared for the day. He gathered with the guild for the usual morning meeting, noticing unusual tension in the group. "Vaelor is gone," Lysandra, second in the Council of Three, announced. Clearly upset, she continued, "We will dispatch two search parties immediately. One led by myself and one led by Thane. Before we go further, does anyone here have knowledge on the whereabouts of Vaelor?"

Two recruits, their faces solemn, spoke up. They had heard tell of Vaelor heading toward the heart of the Forest of Echoes, possibly with others. Lysandra, determined and focused, gathered half of the guild to search that area.

Thane's party included Tank and the other former spearmen of the Shield Bearers. For Thane's party, the Whispering Woods called. The mysteries of the woods presented a path rife with potential discoveries and challenges. Thane, recognizing the value of covering more ground and the allure of the woods' secrets, made his decision.

As Thane's group assembled at the town's edge, a sense of shared purpose united them. Their hearts beat in unison with the rhythm of adventure, their eyes set on the dense, whispering foliage that stretched before them. With a final, lingering glance at the Town of Echoes, they stepped into the embrace of the unknown, their steps echoing with the promise of untold stories.

The journey through the Whispering Woods was marked by an eerie calm, the only disturbance being a distant altercation among the forest's ursine inhabitants. Thane, ever the strategist, opted for a detour, leading his party westward, away from the bears' fray.

Their path brought them to the serene shores of the Lake of Whispers. The water, a mirror to the sky, lay undisturbed, its surface reflecting the quandary that now faced them. To the north lay uncharted territories, their secrets veiled by the horizon; to the south, the familiar path back to the Town of Echoes; and behind them, the enigmatic depths of the Whispering Woods.

There, at the water's edge, Thane's resolve wavered. The decision of whether to venture into new lands, return to the forest's embrace, or follow the lake's edge back to town weighed heavily upon him.

## Chapter 10: Sending Elric and Lina

Aria, the charismatic leader, stands at the heart of the guild, her presence a beacon of strength and stability amidst the chaos. She knows that the challenges facing her guild are not merely external, but also come from within, as each member grapples with their own doubts and fears in the wake of recent events.

In the days following the Elementalists' departure, Aria works tirelessly to maintain the guild's unity and sense of purpose. She organizes training sessions, encouraging her members to hone their skills and strengthen their bonds. She also leads discussions and strategy meetings, seeking to chart a course forward in an increasingly uncertain world.

During one such meeting, a heated debate arises among the guild members. An aggressive faction pushes for a party to explore the purple gate. Others speak of the pressing need to find the second floor boss, need for better training and equipment, and the desire to return to more urban regions which might provide better opportinities or safety.

"My friends," Aria calls with a motion for quiet and a calm pause. "In the face of darkness, it is easy to give in to fear and despair. But we must hold fast to hope, to the belief that together, we can overcome any challenge. We will train, we will prepare, and we will stand ready to defend our home and our people. But we will also seek out allies, forge new connections, and work towards a future where all of Evergreen can thrive."

As Aria speaks, the guild members feel a surge of renewed purpose and determination. They see in their leader a strength that goes beyond mere combat prowess, a wisdom that comes from a deep understanding of the human heart.

In the days that follow, Aria's Guild begins to implement their new strategy. They reach out to other guilds and factions within the town, seeking to build bridges and forge alliances. They also send scouts into the surrounding regions, gathering information about potential threats and opportunities.

Meanwhile, Aria herself seeks information that might hint at the identity or location of the second floor boss, a means of safety for her people, or a means of escape from this world. Her guild's archives, composed of a scant stack of eleven books and three letters in their humble headquarters, reveal nothing of interest. She proceeds to call in her best mage and priest.

"Counselors, we utterly lack the knowledge needed to advance. I propose that we should seek better records, perhaps from nearby studied elves, if any, by some further journey to a larger city, or even by seeking one of these Oracles mentioned in two books of our pitiful library. What do you say?"

Aria's advisors, a wizened mage named Elric and a serene priestess called Lina, exchange thoughtful glances as they consider their leader's words. They, too, have felt the limitations of their current knowledge, and the prospect of seeking wisdom beyond the confines of their guild is both exciting and daunting.

## Chapter 11: The Whisperer

Aria sent Elric to the elven lands and Lina to seek out the Oracles, hoping to gain new knowledge and insights to aid them in the battles to come. Whispers of a powerful necromancer known as the Dread Lord began to circulate, adding to the growing sense of unease in Evergreen.

Eidolon and the Elementalists, having failed in their attempt to retrieve the Aeloria's Whisper, returned to Adlais to seek guidance from the elves. Eidolon, desperate to find a way to resurrect Johan, made the controversial decision to pursue the path of necromancy and seek out a mysterious figure known as "The Whisperer." Despite the reservations of some of his companions, Eidolon remained determined to see this path through to the end.

Eidolon's attempt to recruit additional members for the mission in Adlais was met with complete failure. The locals feared the prospect of associating with a necromancer. In a surprising turn of events, the Order of the Azure Lily unanimously decides to join Eidolon and the Elementalists, believing that their combined knowledge and skills could be invaluable in navigating the dangers ahead.

Back in the Town of Echoes, Tank approached Thane with a proposal to venture into the Forest of Echoes to search for Vaelor and Lysandra's missing party. After a successful recruiting effort, the newly expanded Crimson Vanguard prepared to set out once more, determined to uncover the mysteries that plagued the forest and bring their comrades home.

As these various groups set out on their respective missions, strange and troubling events take place across the world of Evegreen. Rumors swirl, for instance, of distant grasslands turning to desert with magical speed.

## Chapter 12: Shadows of the Past

The Forest of Echoes was eerily silent as Thane's group moved cautiously through the dense trees. The usual sounds of the forest—birdsong, rustling leaves, and distant animal calls—were absent, replaced by an unsettling stillness. The group’s steps were careful, each member alert and on edge, their senses attuned to any sign of danger or movement.

As they advanced, Tank noticed a series of carvings on the trees. He paused to examine them closely. They were insignias of various guilds, including their own, the Crimson Guard. He quickly added their insignia to a nearby tree, marking their passage through this haunting landscape.

"The footprints lead this way," Thane whispered, pointing towards the direction of the Purple Gate. The faint trail of footprints disappeared into the darkness beyond.

The group continued, their destination clear. The Purple Gate loomed ahead, its surface shimmering with an ethereal glow. Without hesitation, they stepped through, crossing into the unknown.

On the other side, they found themselves in a forest that was both familiar and alien. The trees were dark blue, their leaves an inversion of the verdant green they had just left behind. The sky, instead of stretching overhead, seemed to be a landscape of land facing downwards, creating a disorienting effect. To the east and west, where distant mountains might be expected, they saw a landscape of stars, indicating they were in a ring world.

A thunderbolt flashed nearby, casting an eerie glow over the strange landscape. The magical nature of the thunderbolt suggested they were not alone in this inverted realm, and the presence of potent magic hung heavy in the air.

"Take cover," Thane ordered, motioning for the group to blend into the shadows of the dark blue trees. They moved quickly, finding shelter among the unusual foliage.

"This place... it's like nothing I've ever seen," Tank whispered, his hand resting on the hilt of his weapon. "Keep your eyes peeled for any movement."

Lyra, with her keen eyes adjusted to the darkness, spotted faint glows in the distance, beyond the immediate treeline. "There," she pointed, "lights—possibly camps or settlements. Could be other players... or something else."

The group decided to investigate the source of the lights cautiously. As they approached, they realized these were not campfires but luminescent plants emitting a soft, pulsing light. The plants were arranged in a pattern that suggested they might be cultivated or placed deliberately.

Suddenly, a rustling sound alerted them to the presence of another party. From behind a thick, glowing plant, a figure clad in a cloak emerged, their face obscured by the hood. The figure paused, hands raised in a peaceful gesture.

"Travelers," the voice was soft but carried through the silence of the forest, "you are far from the familiar paths."

The party was on edge but listened as the figure continued, "I am Elaerin, a guardian of this realm. You've entered through the Purple Gate, haven't you? Few find their way here by accident."

Elaerin explained that this world was known as the Mirror Vale, a parallel dimension created by ancient magic to serve as a sanctuary and a prison. The dead bodies they passed were unfortunate souls who couldn't survive the realm's trials or its guardians.

"The thunderbolt you saw was a warning—a defense mechanism against unauthorized intruders. But it seems you are not mere invaders. Come, let us speak more safely away from the open paths. I can offer guidance, and perhaps, assistance in your quest."

Elaerin led them to a hidden enclave, skillfully camouflaged within the landscape. Here, amidst ancient artifacts and glowing flora, Elaerin shared the lore of the Mirror Vale. "This place mirrors the real world but inverts it, as you've seen with the sky and the land. It exists in balance with the outer world, and disturbances in one can affect the other."

Elaerin then inquired about their purpose in the Mirror Vale, listening intently as they shared their stories and missions. Sensing their genuine need to return to their world and continue their quest, Elaerin offered to help them navigate the challenges of the Mirror Vale.

"To leave this place, you must reach the Celestial Altar, located at the heart of the Vale. There, the sky touches the ground, and a portal can take you back. But be warned, the path is guarded by creatures twisted by the magic that suffuses this land, and by the trials of the Vale itself."

Armed with this new knowledge and Elaerin's guidance, the group prepared to face the challenges ahead. Their journey through the Mirror Vale would test their resolve, their strength, and their understanding of this bizarre and twisted world.

As they set out towards the Celestial Altar, the bond between them strengthened, knowing that together, they could overcome the trials that awaited and find their way back to their quest in Evergreen.

Tank recalled having seen a couple of the faces of the dead bodies. He tried to remember whether any of the faces were former guild members. Pointing to the armor of a guildmate, indicating the sigil of the guild, he spoke up towards Elaerin. "Have you seen anyone wearing this insignia? We seek in particular one going by the name Vaelor and another called Lysandra?"

Elaerin nodded solemnly. "Yes, I have seen a lady in red leading a party of warriors and mages wearing such an insignia. They headed toward the Altar."

## Chapter 13: The Gatherer of Shadows

Back in the Town of Echoes, under Aria's leadership, the guild was bustling with activity. Aria had dispatched Elric to the elven lands to gain insights into the more arcane aspects of the current crisis facing Evergreen, while Lina had been sent to seek out an Oracle, hoping to glean any prophetic knowledge that might aid in navigating the uncertain future.

In Aria's absence, her second-in-command, a resourceful rogue named Mira, took the lead on daily operations. Mira organized a series of training sessions focusing on defensive tactics and emergency response, anticipating potential threats that might arise during these troubled times. She emphasized teamwork and adaptability, key skills that could make the difference in unforeseen situations.

Meanwhile, a small group within the guild, led by a seasoned warrior named Jorin, began to fortify the guild's headquarters. They reinforced doors and windows, set up surveillance points, and established secure communication lines within the town, ensuring that the guild could stand against a possible attack or provide aid to the townspeople if needed.

As evening approached, Mira gathered the guild members for a strategy meeting. The main topic was the mysterious purple gate that some members had returned from exploring. The reports were mixed, with some describing wondrous sights and others whispering of dangerous encounters. Mira proposed the creation of a specialized task force to further investigate the gate, hoping to understand its nature and potential uses better.

## Chapter 14: Arcane Journeys

Elric's journey to the elven lands was swift, aided by his deep knowledge of the terrain and his ability to commune with nature, a skill he had honed over years. Upon arriving, he was greeted by the Elven Council, wise beings who had observed the changes in Evergreen with deep concern.

Elric presented his case, explaining the challenges faced by Aria's Guild and their need for arcane knowledge. The elves, recognizing the sincerity and urgency of his plea, agreed to help. They granted him access to their ancient library, a treasure trove of forgotten lore and magical texts. Elric spent days poring over the texts, guided by the elven sages, and learned of ancient rituals and spells that might help shield the guild from dark magic.

One particular tome described a protective spell known as the "Veil of the Vale," which could cloak a location in layers of magical concealment, making it nearly impossible for enemies to detect. Elric copied the incantation and the ritual details, planning to implement it upon his return to the Town of Echoes.

Lina's quest to find an Oracle took her through winding paths and secluded villages, where whispers of the Oracle's wisdom were spoken with a mixture of reverence and fear. She finally found the Oracle in a hidden grove, bathed in the light of the full moon.

The Oracle, a mysterious figure cloaked in silver robes, listened quietly as Lina explained her mission. Moved by Lina's earnestness and the dire situation in Evergreen, the Oracle agreed to provide guidance. Through a vision-induced trance, the Oracle spoke of impending trials that would test the strength and unity of Aria's Guild. The Oracle also hinted at a powerful ally who would emerge from the shadows to aid them in their darkest hour.

Armed with new knowledge and a sense of foreboding, Lina prepared to return to the Town of Echoes. She carried with her a small, enchanted amulet given by the Oracle, said to glow in the presence of deceit, a tool that might prove crucial in the days to come.

With Elric and Lina on their respective missions, gathering knowledge and allies, Aria's Guild fortified its position in the Town of Echoes, ready to face whatever challenges lay ahead, bolstered by the guidance and resources their journeys had provided.

## Chapter 15: The Path of Resurrection

Eidolon's group re-entered the Whispering Grove, this time with a focus on finding The Whisperer rather than a search for Aeloria's Whisper. As they moved deeper into the grove, the shadowy, dense foliage loomed ominously around them. This time, their mission was more focused, driven by the urgent need to find The Whisperer and uncover the secrets of necromancy that might help revive their fallen friend.

The air was thick with the earthy scent of moss and the subtle undertones of decay, a stark reminder of the grove's mystical and dangerous nature. With the shadow being that had previously ejected them from the grove aware of their return, it managed to activate a magical trap. As the group moved cautiously through the underbrush, a sudden chill filled the air, and the ground beneath their feet began to tremble. Vines, imbued with a dark energy, burst from the ground, attempting to ensnare the group. The trap, while alarming and forceful, was not entirely effective. Members of the group were able to react just in time to evade complete entrapment, though it slowed their progress significantly and left them rattled.

Despite the initial setback, the group managed to regain their composure and continued their search for The Whisperer. Their determination paid off as subtle clues led them deeper into the heart of the grove.

As they navigated the twisted paths, Eidolon spotted a series of faint, arcane symbols etched into the bark of an ancient tree. Recognizing these as necromantic sigils from his studies, he followed the trail, which led to a secluded clearing obscured by hanging moss and shadow.

In the center of the clearing, a cloaked figure stood over an altar made from stone, surrounded by flickering candles that emitted a ghostly light. The figure was engrossed in a ritual, speaking in low, urgent tones. As the group approached, the figure paused and turned, revealing a face shrouded in mystery and age, eyes glowing with a faint, unnatural light.

"You have come far and faced the shadows of this grove," the figure spoke, his voice echoing slightly in the still air. "I am The Whisperer you seek. What brings you to my domain, seeking the forbidden knowledge of the dead?"

Eidolon stepped forward, explaining their dire need to resurrect their friend and the journeys they had undertaken to reach this moment. The Whisperer listened intently, his expression unreadable. After a moment of silence, he nodded slowly.

"Resurrection is no small matter, and the path you seek is fraught with peril. However, your determination speaks volumes. I will help you, but know this: the balance of life and death is delicate. What is brought back may not return the same."

Malthus, known as The Whisperer, provided a detailed list of the materials required for the resurrection ritual, including Sacred Ashes, Moonwell Water, and a Silver Cord. Eidolon, now armed with detailed knowledge and a plan, prepared to set out on the quest to gather these materials. Each location promised its own set of dangers and mysteries, but the resurrection of his friend drove him forward with a determined resolve.

## Chapter 16: The Birth of the Azure Lily

In the heart of the Whispering Woods, a group of adventurers from various walks of life found themselves united by a common purpose. Led by the wise and compassionate Valenia, a high elf paladin, the Order of the Azure Lily was born.

Valenia had always been driven by a strong sense of justice and a desire to protect the innocent. Her unwavering faith in the divine powers that guided her path had brought her to this moment. As a young elf, she had witnessed the destruction caused by the forces of darkness and had vowed to stand against them. Her journey had led her to gather a group of like-minded individuals, each with their own unique abilities and backgrounds.

Durnan, the dwarf fighter, was the first to join Valenia's cause. With his unmatched strength and resilience, he became a pillar of the group. Cutler, the forest gnome wizard, brought his mastery of illusion magic, adding an element of surprise to their tactics.

Pax, the halfling cleric, had been a devoted follower of the nature deity, and his healing abilities had saved the group on numerous occasions. The newest member of the Order was Kaelyn, a human druid with a mysterious past. Kaelyn's gender identity remained unknown, and they reacted with fierce anger whenever anyone attempted to inquire about or imply their gender. This aspect of their character added a layer of complexity to the group's dynamics, challenging them to confront their own biases and learn to respect Kaelyn's boundaries.

Kaelyn's connection to nature and their ability to wield druidic magic made them an invaluable asset to the team. Their wisdom and unique perspective often provided guidance and solutions to the challenges the Order faced.

Together, the members of the Order of the Azure Lily had faced many trials and emerged stronger for it. United in their purpose and bound by the bonds of friendship and loyalty, they stood ready to confront whatever threats lay ahead.

As Valenia looked upon her companions, she knew that each of them would play a crucial role in the battles to come. With the Order of the Azure Lily by her side, she felt confident that they could overcome any obstacle and bring hope to those who needed it most. The mystery surrounding Kaelyn's gender identity served as a reminder that true unity came from accepting and respecting each other's differences, a lesson that would serve them well in the trials ahead.

## Chapter 17: Trials in the Mirror Vale

As Thane's group ventured deeper into the mysterious Mirror Vale, the eerie blue forest stretched around them, casting long shadows in the otherworldly glow. The air was thick with tension, each member of the party acutely aware of the dangers that lurked within the ethereal woods.

The tranquility of their journey was shattered when a pack of spectral wolves emerged from the shadows, their eyes glowing with a sinister light. The party quickly formed a defensive stance, ready to face the ethereal threat. The battle began in a chaotic blur of claws and steel.

Despite their weariness, the group fought valiantly. Tank and Kael held the front line with their shields, protecting their comrades from the wolves' relentless attacks. Lyra, Selena, and Dorian danced around the battlefield, their blades striking true. Thane and Gavriel launched volleys of magical energy, while Elara focused on healing and support. Marcus, though valiant, was overwhelmed by the wolves' ferocity and was knocked unconscious, his body showing signs of the brutal struggle.

The spectral wolves, empowered by the magic of the forest, launched a fierce assault. For a moment, it seemed as though the party might be overwhelmed. But a surge of magical energy from the Mirror Vale itself infused Thane's party, fortifying their resolve and enhancing their abilities. With renewed strength, they counterattacked fiercely.

In a concerted effort, Lyra's swift strikes, Gavriel's lightning bolts, and Thane's magic missiles began to turn the tide. One by one, the spectral wolves fell, their ethereal forms dissipating into the mist. Elara, despite her drained energy, managed to stabilize Marcus with her healing magic, ensuring he would survive.

After the battle, the group took a moment to catch their breath and tend to their wounds. They discovered valuable loot among the fallen wolves, including spectral pelts, mystic gemstones, an ancient spell scroll, and rare healing herbs. These treasures were a welcome boon, promising to aid them in the trials ahead.

As they left the forest, the group encountered a sudden and heavy downpour. The rain turned the ground into slippery mud, further slowing their progress. Thane urged everyone to be extra careful and quick, but the group's weariness and the challenging conditions made their journey arduous.

The rain-soaked group finally reached the edge of the forest by early afternoon, but the heavy rain and slippery ground extended their travel time significantly. They trudged through the relentless downpour, their spirits dampened but their resolve unbroken.

Night had fallen by the time they finally saw the lights of the town ahead. Exhausted, soaked, and in need of rest, they pressed on, relieved to have reached their destination. Thane's words of encouragement had kept them moving, and now they looked forward to the shelter and respite the town would provide.

As they entered the town, the group was met with curious and concerned looks from the townspeople. Thane led them to a nearby inn, where they could find warmth, food, and a chance to recover from their ordeal. The journey through the Mirror Vale had tested their limits, but they emerged stronger and more united, ready to face whatever challenges lay ahead in their quest to uncover the mysteries of Evergreen.

Tank notices the candlelight flicker in the window of one home. The silhouette appears to have the form of a toad, but standing the height of a man.

## Chapter 18: The Quest for Sacred Ashes and Silver Cords

The Elementalists, a formidable group of adventurers each wielding the power of a different element, continued their quest to resurrect their fallen comrade, Johan, the fire mage. Led by Lyra, the skilled ice mage, they had formed an alliance with the Order of the Azure Lily, united by their shared goal.

Following their encounter with the Whisperer, the enigmatic figure who guided them towards the necessary components for the resurrection ritual, the group set their sights on acquiring the Sacred Ashes and Silver Cords. Eidolon, the agile wood elf rogue, suggested that Lyra and Thorin, the stout male dwarf earth mage, visit the Collector in the nearby elven village of Adlais.

Eidolon handed over his gold and a precious earth crystal to Lyra and Thorin, hoping it would aid in their negotiations. Despite his less-than-persuasive pitch, Lyra agreed to the plan, acknowledging the importance of the materials and the limited options available.

In Adlais, Lyra and Thorin approached the Collector, an elderly elf known for his vast array of rare artifacts and magical relics. Their negotiation was challenging, but the value of the earth crystal and their gold proved sufficient. The Collector, intrigued by their determination, agreed to part with a Silver Cord and a small amount of Sacred Ashes, though he extracted a promise for future favors or rare items.

Returning to the Elementalists, Lyra and Thorin presented their hard-won treasures. "We got what we needed," Lyra announced, handing the items to Eidolon. "But it wasn't easy. The Collector will expect more from us in the future, so we must be prepared."

With the Silver Cord and Sacred Ashes in their possession, the group’s next task was to obtain Moonwell Water. After a thorough discussion, the Elementalists, the Order of the Azure Lily, and the Whisperer agreed that the simplest path was to head to the seat of the elven kingdom to the east. The grand elven city of Luminara, where the Elven King resided, was their destination.

Luminara, known for its majestic architecture and powerful magics, was the heart of the elven realm. It was there that they hoped to find the Moonwell Water, enchanted by the Elven King or his court, to complete their resurrection ritual.

With their plan set, the combined group prepared for the long journey through the Forest of Echoes. They gathered supplies and ensured everyone was ready for the trek. As they set off, Eidolon’s resolve was clear. "Let's move out. The sooner we reach Luminara, the sooner we can bring Johan back."

The journey ahead was filled with anticipation and determination. The Elementalists and the Order of the Azure Lily, guided by the Whisperer, ventured eastward through the mystical forest, united by their mission and strengthened by their bonds. They were ready to face any challenges that lay ahead in their quest to uncover the secrets of Luminara and secure the Moonwell Water necessary for Johan’s resurrection.

## Chapter 19: The Path to the Altar

After a night of much-needed rest in the squirrelfolk town, Thane's party resumed their journey. The morning brought clear skies and a gentle breeze, lifting their spirits as they set off across the expansive plains. Despite the favorable weather, the group remained vigilant, knowing that their quest would not be without its challenges.

The Hidden Grove
Their vigilance paid off when they stumbled upon a hidden grove nestled within the plains. In the center of this grove stood an ancient, ornately carved stone chest, partially covered by moss and vines. With cautious excitement, Thane and his companions opened the chest to reveal a treasure trove of valuable and enchanted items:

Ancient Elven Armor: A beautifully crafted set of armor, lightweight yet incredibly durable, offering significant protection while enhancing agility.
Amulet of Resilience: An amulet granting enhanced resistance to physical and magical attacks.
Scroll of Greater Restoration: A powerful healing scroll capable of curing severe injuries and ailments.
Gold Coins: A substantial amount, ensuring their financial security for the foreseeable future.
The discovery of this treasure provided a much-needed boost to the party’s morale and resources.

Trials on the Plains
The journey through the plains, though initially peaceful, soon tested the group's resolve. They encountered a formidable foe in a fierce battle, emerging victorious but not without sustaining moderate damage. Despite their injuries, the group pressed on, their determination unwavering.

Several party members leveled up from the battle, their abilities and strength growing. Notably, Elaerin unlocked a new ability, adding to their strategic advantage.

Arrival at the Altar
As dusk fell the following evening, Thane’s party finally reached the ancient altar, only to find themselves in the midst of a major battle already in progress. Lysandara, in good health and strong, led her party against the Second Floor Boss—an Evil Vaelor. Possessed and transformed, Evil Vaelor towered over the battlefield, clad in twisted golden armor that mirrored the fearsome Dark Paladin’s.

Alongside Lysandara fought the restored Dark Paladin, now in a smaller, human form, aiding her in the fight against Evil Vaelor. Two parties of elves and a party of squirrelfolk also joined the fray, their combined efforts focused on bringing down the corrupted Vaelor.

Conclusion
Thane’s party, though weary and battered, plunged into the chaotic battle with renewed resolve. The clash of magic and steel echoed through the ancient ruins of the altar as they joined forces with their allies, determined to defeat Evil Vaelor and uncover the secrets of the Mirror Vale.

The stage was set for an epic confrontation, the outcome of which would shape the fate of their world. The battle raged on, each moment fraught with danger and the promise of victory—or devastating defeat.

To Be Continued.

## Chapter 1: Caelum, Who Lived

Caelum creeps the crystal caverns, bow on his back, and stress on his forehead. Born under a rare alignment of moons, Caelum's celestial body glows in a way that is entirely counter to his goal of concealment, but adventageous in that he can navigate such a would-be midnight cavern as if he were in possession of seven arms, each with a fresh torch.

His focus on the mission is questionable, his mind clouded with fragmented memories, glimpses of starlit skies, and whispers of a destiny yet to be uncovered Or is he just talking to himself? Whose voice is that anyway?

With silver-white hair that flows like the milky way and eyes deep blue with flecks of silver, he stands tall and slender, but hunched as he walks, as if a good hunch is the missing ingredient in his recipe for success.

Despite his effort, the crystal spiders find him. Five of them. Caelum readies Starlight, his trusted magical bow, and lets out a volley. One spider less, but the survivors strike undeterred.

A cut, a bruise, a miss. Another shot, and another miss. What has changed? A moment ago the tide was with him. Another cut, this time more severe, and Caelum the recipient. This isn't going well.

Each arrow loosed by Caelum dances with cosmic energy, casting radiant light through the shadowy expanse of the caverns, unmasking his otherwise hidden adversaries. After several more attempts, he takes down a second spider. A moment later, Caelum is flanked. He observes something new about his opponent, the ones he read about and prepared to face but only now has he felt them. "The feet of these crystal spiders are like daggers, aren't they?" The second downed spider rises again, missing a leg, but apparently still capable of continuing.

In the midst of imminent defeat, Caelum's inner voice emerges. "Is this it then? My arrows, my only allies in this dance of light and shadow, yet even they falter against such odds. Each shot, a desperate plea against the darkness. How swift the end approaches! My limbs grow heavy, my vision blurs. The whispers of the stars, once so clear, now fade into silence. Is this the destiny that awaited me? To fall, not with a blaze of glory, but a mere flicker in the endless night? No... it cannot end here, not like this. There must be more, a purpose unfulfilled, a path unseen. Moon above, lend me your strength, for I am not ready to be extinguished."

Despite his plea, he is plagued with doubt. The moon can't be seen from this place. Is it even night? It is certainly night of a kind. In a fleeting moment of stillness, as consciousness slips away and memories cascade through his mind – a vivid reel of his past and glimpses of a destiny still veiled in mystery – he hovers at death's threshold. Miraculously, as if guided by an unseen force, a spark of energy rekindles within him. Returning to consciousness from the precipice of the afterlife, he manages to strike another spider.

A pop of adrenline hits, sending some kind of minor shockwave around him, enough to harm the spider that flanked him. He doubles down on the previously injured spider. He hits. It doesn't come back up. The tide is returning to him. He finishes the spider shaken off by aura, and slowly finishes off the rest.

In the aftermath, Caelum takes a moment to rest, leaning against a glowing crystal, the light casting eerie shadows across his face. The brief respite allows him to gather his strength, though his thoughts linger on the uncertain path ahead. He doesn't have the energy to harvest the large crystals from the wall, but he collects some of the crystal fragments from the fallen spiders and recoups some of his lost arrows.

# Prologue: The Unintended Consequence

A quick smell of carrot. A blurry view of a black circle on a white background.

Dr. Christina Hayes blinked and found herself in front of her computer again.

"It worked! I must go tell the others," she thought. Within a second of the thought, before her hand could complete the task of removing her glasses, a different and gruesome vision exploaded across her conciousness without invitation.

The sun was too bright. The building appeared damaged and abandoned. No one was to be seen, and nothing was to be heard but a bit of wind. Christina glances to the sky - what is that? Some massive vehicle or a moon? Is it breaking or executing some kind of propulsion?

Dr. Hayes winced with a flash of migraine and her hand shakily removed the glasses. She felt her heart racing with a mixture of excitement and dread. The year was 2336, and she had just made a groundbreaking discovery linking consciousness with directed quark manipulation. Her remote viewing experiment, it seems, provided an additional unexpected view of the future.

"Nevermind," she thought. "I can't share this with anyone. I need time to think."

"Alg!" she coughed, her voice breaking with anxiety. "Algo 2336! Attention. You saw what happened, yes? Then we can reverse the transport and evacuate conciousness as well."

She hears footsteps down the hall. "Algo 2336, broadcast a reversed form of this quark protocol from the cross-planetary array, now. Take care of the details yourself. I want all conciousness paused until I can investigate what we just saw."

The AI began to protest and confirm. "This action requires -"

"Override." Dr. Hayes interrupted. "Allocate all resources immediately." The steps down the hall grew closer. Her prototype buzzed.

"Welcome to Evergreen, Raeve!" Christina - now Raeve, felt a chill go down her spine at the recognition of the login confirmation message.

"This game? I haven't played this in a decade," she thought. She heard a whisper in an odd and different tone. "Task completed. Consciousnesses have been transferred to Evergreen, the open-source virtual game environment. Estimated success rate: 90-99% of conscious advanced intelligence in the solar system."

Raeve gasped, realizing what had happened. ALGO2336 had included her in the mass consciousness transfer. It had transferred her mind into Evergreen, a popular open-source fantasy game.

As the reality of her situation sank in, Raeve looks around to see a romanesque garden that she vaguely recalls. She's in the region of Olympia and she hears a commotion in the distance. She walks according to instinct, feeling the strength of her archer hands as she walks. Raeve emerges at the edge of a vast arena where thousands of characters gather, their faces a mix of confusion and fear.

Above them all, a monstrous figure materialized in the sky, its voice booming across the land. "Inhabitants of Evergreen, hear me! You are now bound to this world. None shall leave until the 100th floor boss is defeated. Your actions here have consequences beyond what you can imagine. Prepare yourselves, for the challenges ahead are greater than any you have faced before."

As the figure faded, leaving stunned silence in its wake, Raeve's mind raced. This was not part of her plan. Something had gone terribly wrong, and now she was trapped along with everyone else, facing unknown dangers in a world that was suddenly all too real.

# Chapter 1: The Olympian Dilemma

The sun rose over Olympia, its golden rays illuminating a city in turmoil. The annual Evergreen Olympics, once a celebration of virtual skill and friendly competition, had taken on a new, desperate significance. Players from all corners of the digital realm flocked to the city, some seeking glory, others hoping to find answers or a way out of their newfound prison.

In the bustling marketplace, a curious sight caught the attention of passersby. A Kenku, a humanoid bird-creature with sleek black feathers, stood perplexed before a notice board. This was Bloom, an uncommon male Kenku Archmage, though he had no recollection of choosing this form or entering the game. His beady eyes scanned the announcements, trying to make sense of his situation.

"Water magic competition at the Poseidon Arena," Bloom read aloud, his voice a mix of different tones and accents—a trademark of his race's mimicry ability. He felt an affinity for water magic, though he couldn't explain why. As an Archmage, he knew he had access to both elemental and exotic magical skills, but the specifics eluded him.

Shaking his feathered head, Bloom made his way towards the arena. If he was to understand this world and his place in it, participating in these games seemed as good a start as any.

Meanwhile, at the edge of the practice fields, a lizardfolk mage named Obama was preparing for his events. Unlike Bloom, Obama had a clear recollection of logging into Evergreen. He remembered his real-world identity as Malik, a skilled gamer who had trained extensively for these Olympics. The duality of his existence—Malik's memories in Obama's scaled body—was a constant source of fascination and confusion.

Obama's lizard-like eyes narrowed as he focused on a nearby pond. With a wave of his clawed hand, he summoned a swirling vortex of water. As an advanced elementalist from the rainforest, he had a natural affinity for water magic, with a secondary earth affinity particularly attuned to wood and plants.

"This is it, Malik," he muttered to himself, his forked tongue flicking out nervously. "Time to show them what a rainforest lizard can do."

Across the field, a figure stood out among the crowd—not for any outlandish appearance, but for the aura of disdain that seemed to radiate from him. This was Lachlan, a male celestial athlete with a particular talent for archery and magical jumping. Like Bloom, Lachlan had no memory of entering Evergreen or choosing his avatar. His mind was a blank slate before the moment of the Monstrous Vision, leaving him to question the very nature of his existence.

As Lachlan approached the archery range, whispers followed in his wake. His celestial nature marked him as one of the elite, a status he seemed to wear like a second skin despite his lack of memories. He picked up a bow, its weight familiar in his hands though he couldn't recall ever holding one before.

"Lachlan," called out one of the officials, "you're up for the qualifier."

Without a word, Lachlan stepped up to the line. In one fluid motion, he nocked an arrow, drew the bow, and released—all without seeming to aim. The arrow flew true, splitting the central target. Without waiting for the shocked gasps to subside, Lachlan simply turned and walked away, as if the feat was beneath his notice.

In the midst of this commotion, Raeve found herself at the periphery of the gathering crowd. The weight of her knowledge—of her true identity as Christina and the unintended consequences of her actions—bore down on her. She watched the other competitors with a mix of guilt and fascination, knowing that each of them was here because of her.

As the games progressed, each participant faced their own trials. Bloom struggled in the swimming events, his Kenku nature more suited to land than water despite his magical affinity. Obama, drawing on Malik's training and his lizardfolk's natural abilities, emerged victorious in the aquatic competitions. Lachlan dominated in long jump and archery, his celestial nature evident in every effortless performance.

Raeve, still adjusting to her new reality and the weight of her secret, failed to qualify in archery—a bitter irony given her avatar's supposed skills. As she watched the others compete, she couldn't help but wonder: how many of them remembered their real lives? How many were lost, confused, playing along because they had no other choice?

As the sun began to set on the first day of the Olympian games, tension hung in the air. The initial shock of their imprisonment had worn off, replaced by a grim determination. For some, like Obama, the games were a chance to prove their worth. For others, like Bloom and Lachlan, they were a means of understanding their new existence. And for Raeve, they were a stark reminder of the enormous responsibility she bore.

Little did they know that their performances in these games would soon catapult them into roles far more crucial than mere athletic competition. As night fell over Olympia, the gods themselves were taking notice, setting in motion events that would shape the fate of Evergreen and perhaps reality itself.

# Chapter 2: Divine Machinations

As the first stars appeared in the digital sky above Olympia, the gods gathered in their celestial palace atop Mount Olympus. Zeus, king of the gods, sat upon his golden throne, his brow furrowed in concern. Around him, the other deities of the Olympian pantheon murmured amongst themselves, their usual bickering set aside in the face of this unprecedented crisis.

"Silence," Zeus thundered, his voice echoing through the vast hall. The other gods fell quiet, their attention fixed on their king. "We face a threat unlike any we have encountered in the millennia of our existence. The barriers of our world have been breached, and with them, the very nature of our reality is in question."

Athena, goddess of wisdom and war, stepped forward. "Father, we must act swiftly. The mortals trapped in our realm grow restless. If we do not provide direction, chaos will ensue."

Zeus nodded gravely. "You speak truly, daughter. But our options are limited. We cannot simply undo what has been done—the magic that binds these souls to our world is beyond even our power to break."

From the shadows at the edge of the hall, Hades spoke, his voice low and measured. "Then we must adapt. Use this situation to our advantage. These mortals, with their knowledge of the world beyond, could be valuable allies in understanding and combating this threat."

A murmur of agreement rippled through the assembled gods. Zeus stroked his beard thoughtfully before coming to a decision. "Very well. We shall continue with the Olympic games. They will serve as a means to identify capable individuals among these newcomers. Athena, you will oversee the selection process for a team to investigate the hellgates. Hades, gather intelligence and maintain order in Olympia. I will lead an expedition to seek out Prometheus."

As the meeting adjourned, the gods dispersed to carry out their assigned tasks. Little did they know that among the countless souls now inhabiting Evergreen, a select few would soon play pivotal roles in the unfolding drama.

# Chapter 3: Trials of Skill and Spirit

The following days saw Olympia transformed into a spectacle of magical prowess and athletic excellence. The air crackled with energy as competitors from all corners of Evergreen showcased their abilities, each event more dazzling than the last.

In the Poseidon Arena, Bloom stood at the edge of a massive, magically suspended sphere of water. His feathers ruffled nervously as he eyed the other competitors—merfolk, water elementals, and other beings far more suited to aquatic environments than a Kenku.

"Next up, Bloom the Archmage," announced the officiator, his voice magically amplified.

Taking a deep breath, Bloom stepped into the water sphere. For a moment, panic seized him as he felt the liquid envelop his body. But then, almost instinctively, he tapped into his arcane knowledge. The water around him began to swirl, forming intricate patterns that glowed with an inner light.

From the stands, Athena watched with keen interest. "Curious," she murmured to herself. "He shows a natural affinity for water magic, yet his form is ill-suited for it. A contradiction that bears watching."

Despite his initial impressive display, Bloom's performance in the water-based events was ultimately lackluster. As he climbed out of the sphere after his final event, dripping and slightly discouraged, he couldn't shake the feeling that he had failed some crucial test.

Meanwhile, on the other side of the arena complex, Obama was making waves—literally. In the swimming competition, his lizardfolk form cut through the water with preternatural speed. But it was in the magical events that he truly shone.

Standing on a floating platform, Obama faced off against a burly water elemental. At the signal, both began to manipulate the pool beneath them. The elemental summoned a massive wave, but Obama countered with a spell that transmuted the water into a tangle of seaweed, ensnaring his opponent.

"Incredible," muttered a nearby judge. "He's combining water and earth magic in ways I've never seen."

Obama, or Malik as he still thought of himself, allowed a small smile of satisfaction. His training in the real world, combined with his avatar's innate abilities, was paying off. Yet even as he basked in his victory, a part of him wondered about the true nature of this competition. Why were they really here? What was the purpose behind these elaborate games?

As the aquatic events concluded, attention shifted to the archery range. Lachlan stood alone, his celestial aura setting him apart from the other competitors. When his turn came, he approached the firing line with a casual grace that bordered on arrogance.

The first round was a standard target shoot. Lachlan, without so much as a glance at his target, fired off three arrows in rapid succession. Each found its mark dead center, splitting the arrows that came before.

For the second round, a series of moving, shrinking, and even invisible targets were conjured. Lachlan donned the ceremonial helm of Olympia, a piece of equipment that was supposed to magically guide the archer's aim. But as he removed it after another perfect score, those close by could have sworn they heard him mutter, "Unnecessary crutch."

The final round was the true test of magical archery. Competitors were required to imbue their arrows with various elemental and mystical properties, hitting targets that could only be affected by specific types of magic.

Lachlan's performance was nothing short of miraculous. His arrows seemed to change their properties mid-flight, corkscrewing through the air in impossible arcs before striking their marks with devastating precision. The crowd watched in awe, but Lachlan's expression remained impassive, almost bored.

From her vantage point, Athena's eyes narrowed. "He's holding back," she realized. "But why? What game is he playing?"

As the archery event concluded, all eyes turned to the shapeshifting competition—a event that Raeve had been both anticipating and dreading. As she stepped into the arena, she could feel the weight of expectation pressing down on her.

The challenge was to adapt to a series of rapidly changing environments, shifting forms to best survive each scenario. Raeve took a deep breath, focusing on the skills she knew her avatar possessed. As the first environment materialized—a scorching desert—she felt her body begin to change.

Her skin hardened into scales, her form elongating into that of a giant serpent perfectly adapted to the harsh conditions. But even as she marveled at the sensation, her mind was elsewhere. How much of this was the game, and how much was real? Were the other competitors truly changing, or was this all an elaborate illusion?

These thoughts distracted her, causing her to lag behind in the transformations. By the time the final scenario appeared—a turbulent, storm-wracked sky—Raeve had fallen to the middle of the pack.

Frustrated and conflicted, she forced herself to focus. Her body shimmered and changed, taking on the form of a majestic dragon. She soared through the conjured tempest, her powerful wings easily navigating the fierce winds. For a moment, she lost herself in the exhilaration of flight, forgetting her worries and guilt.

But as she landed and the competition came to a close, reality came crashing back. She hadn't won, hadn't even placed in the top ranks. As the crowd's attention turned to the victors, Raeve slipped away, her mind churning with questions and doubts.

Unbeknownst to the competitors, their every move had been scrutinized not just by the spectators, but by the gods themselves. As night fell on Olympia, Zeus convened a private meeting with Athena and Hades.

"Well?" he demanded. "What have you observed?"

Athena stepped forward, her grey eyes gleaming with insight. "There are several individuals of note, Father. The Kenku Archmage, Bloom, shows potential far beyond his apparent abilities. His struggle with water magic, despite his affinity for it, suggests a depth of character that could prove valuable."

Hades nodded in agreement. "I sensed a similar quality in him. A questioning nature, perhaps?"

"Indeed," Athena continued. "Then there's the lizardfolk mage, Obama. His skill is undeniable, but more intriguing is his apparent retention of memories from before the Monstrous Vision. He could provide insights into the world beyond our realm."

Zeus stroked his beard thoughtfully. "And what of the celestial archer? His performance was... remarkable."

A frown crossed Athena's face. "Lachlan is an enigma. His skills far surpass what should be possible for a newcomer to our world, yet he seems utterly disinterested in his own abilities. I suspect there's more to him than meets the eye."

"And the shapeshifter?" Hades inquired, his dark eyes glinting with curiosity.

Athena's expression softened slightly. "Raeve... she's different from the others. Her abilities are impressive, but it's her demeanor that intrigues me. She carries a weight, a burden of knowledge perhaps, that sets her apart. I believe she may be key to understanding the true nature of our current predicament."

Zeus rose from his throne, his massive form radiating power. "Very well. These four shall be our focus. Athena, I task you with assembling a team to investigate the hellgates. Include Raeve in this group; let us see how she performs under pressure."

Turning to Hades, Zeus continued, "Brother, I need you to remain here and maintain order in Olympia. The Kenku, Bloom, could be of use to you in this regard. His unique perspective may help navigate the political complexities that are sure to arise."

Hades inclined his head in acknowledgment. "And what of the others? Obama and Lachlan?"

"They will join me," Zeus declared. "I intend to seek out Prometheus, to request the creation of Aletheia, the goddess of truth. We will need her power to compel the oracles to reveal the locations and weaknesses of the floor bosses."

As the meeting concluded, the three deities went their separate ways, each pondering the challenges that lay ahead. Little did they know that their carefully laid plans would soon be tested in ways they could never have anticipated.

# Chapter 4: Diverging Paths

The days following the Olympic games saw a flurry of activity across Olympia. The gods and their chosen representatives began assembling teams and making preparations for their respective missions.

Bloom, the Kenku Archmage, found himself approached by one of Hades' lieutenants. The dark-robed figure explained that Hades was seeking individuals with unique perspectives to help maintain order in Olympia. Intrigued by the opportunity to delve deeper into the mysteries of Evergreen, Bloom accepted the offer.

Meanwhile, Obama, the lizardfolk mage, was surprised to receive a summons from Zeus himself. The king of the gods was assembling a diverse team for an expedition to seek out Prometheus, and Obama's dual nature—his memories of the world beyond Evergreen—made him a valuable asset.

Lachlan, the celestial archer, was also selected for Zeus's team. His exceptional skills had not gone unnoticed, and the god-king believed that Lachlan's abilities would be crucial for the challenges that lay ahead.

Raeve, still grappling with the weight of her secret, found herself drawn into Athena's mission almost by accident. As she wandered the streets of Olympia, trying to make sense of her situation, she overheard a group of warriors discussing Athena's call for volunteers to investigate the hellgates.

Seeing an opportunity to perhaps undo some of the damage she had inadvertently caused, Raeve approached the group. "Excuse me," she said, her voice steadier than she felt, "I'd like to volunteer for Athena's mission."

The warriors looked at her skeptically. One of them, a burly man with a scarred face, spoke up. "You? What skills do you bring to such a dangerous task?"

Raeve straightened her shoulders. "I'm an archer," she said, "and a shapeshifter. I may not have won any medals in the games, but I'm willing to face whatever dangers lie ahead."

The group exchanged glances, then the scarred warrior shrugged. "It's not for us to decide. You'll have to convince Lady Athena herself. She's assembling her team in the sacred grove near the temple. Good luck—you'll need it."

With a mix of determination and trepidation, Raeve made her way to Athena's sacred grove. As she approached, she saw the goddess of wisdom and war addressing a group of about two dozen individuals—a mix of humans, elves, and other races, all looking battle-hardened and capable.

Athena's piercing grey eyes fell on Raeve as she joined the group. "And who might you be?" the goddess asked, her voice carrying easily across the grove.
Raeve swallowed hard. "I'm Raeve, my lady. I've come to volunteer for your mission to the hellgates."

A murmur ran through the assembled warriors. Athena raised an eyebrow. "Indeed? And what makes you think you're qualified for such a dangerous task?"

In that moment, Raeve made a decision. Drawing upon her shapeshifting abilities, she began to change. Her form grew, scales erupting from her skin, wings unfurling from her back. Where once stood a hesitant human, now a majestic dragon reared up.

For a moment, silence reigned in the grove. Then, to everyone's shock, Athena burst into laughter. It wasn't mocking or cruel, but genuine, full-bodied laughter that seemed to shake the very air around them.

"Oh, by all the gods," Athena gasped between peals of laughter, "you are a delight! A dragon? Really?"

With a casual wave of her hand, Athena dispelled Raeve's transformation. The dragon form melted away, leaving Raeve standing there, human once more and utterly bewildered.
"My dear," Athena said, wiping tears of mirth from her eyes, "you have spirit, I'll give you that. But there are levels to this game that you can't even begin to comprehend."
It was then that Raeve realized the true gap between them. Athena wasn't just powerful—she was on an entirely different plane of existence within Evergreen.

"I... I apologize, Lady Athena," Raeve said, bowing her head in embarrassment. "I only wanted to help."

Athena's expression softened slightly. "No need to apologize. Your courage and your unintentional comedy are refreshing. Very well, Raeve. You may join our mission. But remember—bravery without wisdom is a quick path to the underworld. You have much to learn."

As Raeve took her place among the other chosen warriors, she couldn't help but feel a mix of relief and apprehension. She was one step closer to potentially fixing the chaos she had caused, but the challenges ahead were far greater than she had imagined.

Little did Raeve know that her impulsive action had caught Athena's interest more than she realized. The goddess of wisdom saw something in Raeve—a hidden depth, a burden of knowledge perhaps—that set her apart from the others. As Athena began outlining the details of their mission to investigate the hellgates, she made a mental note to keep a close eye on this intriguing shapeshifter.

# Chapter 5: Preparations and Revelations

The day that followed the divine assignments was a whirlwind of activity across Olympia. In every corner of the city, preparations were underway for the various missions that would soon depart.

Bloom, embracing his new role as Hades' intelligence gatherer, spent the morning in quiet contemplation in one of Olympia's many gardens. As he sat motionless, his feathers blending with the shadows of a large oak tree, the local wildlife gradually forgot his presence. Birds chirped their secrets, squirrels chattered about hidden caches, and even the insects buzzed with gossip.

To any passerby, it would have seemed that the Kenku was simply enjoying a moment of peace. But Bloom's mind was afire with information. He was creating a mental map of Olympia's undercurrents—the fears, the rumors, the brewing discontent. As the sun reached its zenith, he made his way back to Hades' palace, ready to deliver his first report.

Hades listened intently as Bloom recounted what he had learned. Tales of secret meetings among influential figures, whispers of foreign spies, and rumors of bandits preparing to take advantage of the chaos.

"Excellent work," Hades commended, his dark eyes glinting with approval. "Continue your efforts, Bloom. But be cautious. Knowledge is power, but it can also be a double-edged sword."

Across the city, in the bustling marketplace, Obama was gathering supplies for the upcoming journey. His lizardfolk form drew curious glances from passersby, but he paid them no mind. His thoughts were focused on the task ahead—and on the strange duality of his existence.

As he haggled with a merchant over the price of enchanted water skins, Obama found himself slipping between his two identities. One moment he was Malik, the skilled gamer, approaching the situation like a quest in an RPG. The next, he was Obama, the lizardfolk mage, fully immersed in the world of Evergreen.

"It's getting harder to separate the two," he muttered to himself as he left the marketplace, his arms laden with supplies. "Am I Malik playing a game, or Obama living a life? Where does one end and the other begin?"

Meanwhile, in a secluded training ground on the outskirts of Olympia, Lachlan was putting himself through a rigorous series of exercises. Despite his apparent nonchalance about his abilities, the celestial archer seemed determined to push his limits.

Arrow after arrow flew from his bow, each finding its mark with unerring accuracy. He moved with a fluid grace that seemed almost impossible, leaping from platform to platform as he fired, never missing a beat.

As he trained, Lachlan's mind wandered. Why couldn't he remember anything before the Monstrous Vision? Why did these incredible abilities feel so natural to him? And why, despite his lack of memories, did he feel such an innate disdain for the Olympians?

The sun was setting by the time Lachlan finally lowered his bow. He had found no answers, but the physical exertion had helped to quiet the constant buzz of questions in his mind. As he made his way back to the city, he resolved to approach the upcoming journey with an open mind. Perhaps the answers he sought lay beyond Olympia's borders.

In contrast to the others' focused preparations, Raeve's day was chaotic and filled with a growing sense of anxiety. Tasked with assembling a team for Athena's mission, she found herself navigating the complex social and political landscape of Olympia.

Her first attempts at recruitment were met with skepticism and outright refusal. Many were hesitant to leave the relative safety of the city, especially for a mission involving the dreaded hellgates. Others questioned her authority, demanding to know why a newcomer was given such an important task.

As the day wore on and her list of potential recruits grew shorter, Raeve felt the weight of her responsibility—both as Athena's chosen assembler and as Christina, the unwitting architect of their current situation—bearing down on her.

It was late afternoon when she decided to approach Athena herself, hoping for guidance or at least some divine intervention to aid in her task. She found the goddess in her sacred grove, seemingly deep in thought.

"Lady Athena," Raeve began hesitantly, "I... I'm struggling with the task you've given me. Many are reluctant to join our mission, and others question my role in it."

Athena turned to face her, her grey eyes unreadable. "And what do you think, Raeve? Do you question your role as well?"

The question caught Raeve off guard. Did she question her role? As Christina, she knew all too well why she was here. But as Raeve, the character she was now living as, should she be questioning this assignment?

"I... I'm not sure," she admitted finally. "I want to help, to make a difference. But perhaps I'm not the right person for this task."

A small smile played at the corners of Athena's lips. "Doubt is the beginning of wisdom, Raeve. It is those who never question their roles that we should be wary of." The goddess paused, studying Raeve intently. "Very well. If you believe you cannot lead this team, then perhaps you should prove yourself worthy of following it."

Before Raeve could respond, Athena's form began to shimmer with divine light. When it faded, the goddess stood before her in full battle regalia, her spear gleaming and her shield bearing the fearsome visage of Medusa.

"Face me in combat, Raeve," Athena challenged, her voice ringing with power. "Show me the strength of your convictions, the depth of your determination. Prove to me, and to yourself, that you belong on this mission."

Raeve's heart raced. A duel with Athena? It seemed impossible, suicidal even. But as she looked into the goddess's eyes, she saw something there—a glimmer of expectation, of hope perhaps.

In that moment, Raeve made her decision. Drawing upon her shapeshifting abilities, she began to change. Her form grew, scales erupting from her skin, wings unfurling from her back. Where once stood a hesitant human, now a majestic dragon reared up, ready to face the goddess of war.

As Raeve and Athena faced off, the air crackling with tension and magical energy, neither could have predicted the far-reaching consequences of this duel. For in this moment of challenge and transformation, the threads of fate were being rewoven, setting the stage for battles and revelations that would shake the very foundations of Evergreen.

# Chapter 6: The Abyssal Gate

Raeve stood at the edge of a precipice, her eyes fixed on the swirling vortex of darkness before her. The Abyssal Gate lived up to its name, a yawning maw of pitch-black energy that seemed to devour light itself. Beside her, Athena's usual air of confidence was tempered with a grim determination.

"I've seen many dangers in my time," Athena murmured, her gray eyes reflecting the gate's ominous glow, "but this... this is something else entirely."
Their two companions, hardened warriors chosen for their skill and bravery, shifted uneasily. The absence of Lysander, their scout who had failed to return, weighed heavily on all of them.

Raeve felt a chill run down her spine, a stark reminder that despite her avatar's abilities, she was still Christina at her core – a researcher thrust into a world more dangerous than she could have imagined. She turned to Athena, "What's our plan of approach?"

Athena's lips curved into a wry smile. "Cautiously, of course. But we need to get closer to understand what we're dealing with. Your shapeshifting abilities might come in handy here, Raeve. Perhaps a form that can withstand the gate's energy?"

Nodding, Raeve closed her eyes, focusing on her dragon form once again. This time, instead of the showy transformation she had attempted with Athena before, she concentrated on creating a smaller, more agile version. Her skin hardened into scales, wings sprouted from her back, but she remained roughly human-sized.

"Impressive," Athena nodded approvingly. "Now, let's move in. Stay alert, all of you. We don't know what—"

Her words were cut short by a deafening roar that seemed to emanate from the gate itself. The ground beneath their feet began to tremble, and from the swirling vortex, a massive, tentacled form began to emerge.

"By the gods," one of their companions gasped, "it's a Kraken!"

But this was no ordinary Kraken. Its flesh seemed to shimmer and shift, as if it wasn't fully in their reality. Tendrils of dark energy crackled around it, floating in the air, and where its eyes should have been, there were only voids like absent clouds.

Athena's face paled, a sight Raeve never thought she'd see. "This is beyond what we prepared for. That creature... it's infused with the essence of the Abyss itself."

As this Shadow Kraken fully emerged, its tentacles lashing out with impossible speed, Raeve realized that this was the moment everything changed. This wasn't just a game anymore. The danger was real, the consequences dire.

With a cry that was part battle roar, part desperate prayer, Athena charged forward, her divine weapons blazing with light. Raeve, in her dragon form, took to the air, ready to rain down fire upon the monstrosity.

As the battle began, Raeve couldn't help but wonder: was this the future she had seen? Had her actions to prevent a catastrophe only served to bring about something far worse?
The fate of Evergreen, and perhaps reality itself, now hung in the balance as they faced a threat that challenged even the gods themselves.

    - in the meantime, caelum mentors many young mages in the area including those at the school
    - the story is narrated as a series of scholarly letters or journal entries, many coming from the university professors and some coming from priests, nobels, and guild leaders. the scholars are frantically trying to collate world knowledge in an effort to defeat higher level bosses, survive, minimize deaths, and possibly even hack out of the game universe sooner than reaching the 100th floor boss if possible. many of the scholars are real-world researchers or technical folks of various kinds.
    - at the end, caelum the elder sacrifices himself to defeat lunaria, the 14th floor boss. we learn that his defeat of lunaria is a fulfillment of a prophet called ezekiel: "he that lives must die"
    - in aria's arc they discover these letters and journal entries at some point

        - monarch of the dreamers
        - monarch of regalis
        - the dwarf monarch of new olympia
        - this, besides monarchs of the past and hell. there are also smaller regional nobles and warlords that might regard themselves as a king, but they don't hold a candle to these folks. for example, there are many royal dragons that might be considered effectively an absolute ruler over some small portion of dragonica, but not the whole region.

### Chapter 1: Goblin Fight!

In the heart of Evergreen, an MMORPG world where fantasy and technology entwine, a band of adventurers journey through the dense undergrowth. Eorhelm, clad in shimmering silver armor, led the way, his sword a beacon in the growing twilight. Beside him, Lunara, the elven archer, moved with a purpose born of urgent necessity. Her keen eyes, ever scanning the shadows, were not just in search of foes but a path to survival.

Drogan Flamebeard, a dwarf mage, and the Automaton Guardian No. 7519, a relic of forgotten technologies, completed their party. Each step they took was laden with the weight of a dire revelation. Minutes ago they had been visited by a fantastic and terrifying beast in the sky. The monster informed them that they will be unable to log out of Evergreen for the foreseeable future. Only by defeating the 100th floor boss do the players have a chance to see their friends and families again, and the death of their characters now risks consequences far beyond the originally accepted terms of service.

Lunara’s ears twitched at the faintest rustling – the whisper of leather and the clink of poorly fastened armor. “Goblins,” she hissed, signaling the others. Her instincts, honed by years of navigating the treacherous woods, had led them to their quarry: a warband of goblins, skulking about with nefarious intent.

Eorhelm, his eyes alight with a battle-hunger sharpened by their predicament, nodded. “A test of our mettle,” he murmured. The Automaton beeped in agreement, its sensors analyzing the terrain for tactical advantage. The Automaton, processing a thousand scenarios a second, positioned itself to flank the goblins. It communicated in a series of soft beeps, a tactical map forming in its mind.

With the precision of a predator, Lunara notched an arrow. Her breath was a silent mist in the cool air. The goblins, oblivious to the impending doom, continued their plotting around a dimly lit campfire.

Then, like a storm unleashed, Eorhelm charged. His sword sang its deadly song, cleaving the air as it sought the goblin leader. Lunara’s arrow flew, a streak of death in the twilight. It found its mark in the heart of a goblin scout.

Chaos erupted. The goblins, caught unawares, scrambled, their crude weapons clattering in the sudden frenzy. Drogan’s staff pulsed, ready to unleash hellfire. The Automaton moved with a grace unexpected of its form, engaging the goblins with calculated precision.

The goblin leader, a brutish hobgoblin with scars of many battles, roared and rallied his troops. He was formidable, but Eorhelm was a tempest. Their blades clashed, a dance of death under the starlit sky.

In the heart of the Evergreen, a new legend was being forged. Each strike, each spell woven, each arrow loosed, was a note in the symphony of their saga. The adventurers, bound by fate and steel, fought not just for survival, but for the stories that would be told of this night - stories that would echo through the annals of time, in the mysterious and magical realm of Evergreen.

In the aftermath of the battle, a hushed tranquility enveloped the Evergreen forest. The victorious party, bearing the marks of their recent skirmish, gathered around the spoils of their hard-won fight. The automaton collected the goblins' meager treasures. Among the scattered possessions, a curious amulet, glinting with an eerie luminescence, was retrieved from the fallen Hobgoblin Leader. Alongside it lay a parchment, its surface etched with cryptic runes and symbols, unparseable to the low level android and his allies.

As the sun dipped below the horizon, painting the sky with strokes of crimson and gold, the weary but resolute adventurers continued their journey through the forest. Guided by the inherent wisdom of the woods, they traverse eastward, their path winding through ancient trees where light and shadow dance.

They soon find themselves by the banks of a crystal-clear stream. As Lunara gazes into the water, she notices the play of light on the riverbed. Pebbles and stones, smoothed over eons, formed a mosaic beneath the surface. Tiny fish, silver and quick, darted between the rocks, their movements a dance of life in the tranquil stream.

Here, the group slows its pace, the gentle sound of flowing water providing a soothing counterpoint to the day’s violence. They forage along the banks, finding some berries, and contemplating their next move. The party was torn between the allure of the forest's depths and the practical need to rest. The stream whispers of hidden paths and untold stories, yet, the proposal to set up camp under the ancient trees, fresh water waiting nearby for sunrise, is equally compelling. Drogan made his hunger clear by means of four repititions throughout the conversation.

The automaton hands Drogan a berry. Drogan scoffs, accepting the gift nevertheless, tosses it back, and runs his hands through the stream. The air around them was cool and the stream carried a similar chill, refreshing while carrying a briskness that spoke of mountain origins.

## Chapter 2: Chef Drogan of The Molten Depths

"It comes from the mountains," Drogan thinks to himself. Suddenly, nostalgic memories of childhood carry him away suddenly. "It comes from the mountains, just as I do."

While the waters melted from snowy tops, Drogan rose from fiery depths. The flames were always kind to Drogan, and he always loved them. The flames were not other than the rocks or waters to Drogan. The mages he trained with decades later, whether human or elf, could never understand that fire was a friend of water. Yes, water can quell a burning tree, but this hardly makes them enemies, and such a contrived case is an exceedingly rare form of the union of those elements. "It hardly scratches the surface," Drogan chuckles as his memories continue to flow, "as one expects of a surface-dweller."

For Drogan, the purest flame is liquid, made of rock and metal, such as the one that ran bright and red just outside the town of his youth in the Molten Depths. This flame is found deeper, runs hotter, and is hardly bothered by a douse. They keep water hot in every house at every hour for bathing, cooking, or tea. Water and magma intertwined properly power the mining tools by steam. When smoke, coal mining, or illness trouble the nose and lungs of the locals, a steam sauna would often be prescribed as a fast and natural cure.

Drogan's formative years in the Molten Depths, a bustling Dwarven region under the mountains skirting Dragonica, were steeped in the fusion of fire and stone. The magma rivers were as familiar to him as the comforting warmth of a hearth. More comforting still, and more formative still, were the culinary arts of mom and dad. The smell of fresh bread and perfectly seared meat race through Drogan's mind.

His family, renowned in the region among the clans, were nurturers rather than warriors, wielding flame and metal instruments primarily in the kitchen. While many dwarves grew up to the sound of a clanging hammer or a mining pick, Drogan sprouted amidst clanging pans, surrounded by tales of ancient magics and culinary feasts.

As a young dwarf, he learned to summon and control flames with a precision that could forge the strongest alloys or gently simmer a stew to perfection. The kitchens of his home became his first battleground, where he honed his skills and deepened his understanding of fire's myriad utility and multifaceted nature.

It was nearly time for Drogan to take his rightful place as Head Chef, allowing his father to retire, when his town was decimated. A less delectable faction of dwarves, openly allied to demonic forces, invaded and pushed out the natives. Drogan's father was killed, although his mother and siblings survived. Drogan immediately refocused his energy to train in battle magic, vowing to protect his family and aid in the eventual restoration of the Molten Depths.

Drogan's stomach grumbles. He finds himself again staring into the stream. "Guardian, grab a few of these fish. I don't care if we make camp now or later, but I won't be waiting any longer to eat."

## Chapter 3: A Temple in the Forest

The Automaton Guardian, hearing Drogan's request, nods and moves towards the stream. Its sensors scan the water, identifying the movement patterns of the fish. With a swift, precise motion, it reaches into the stream and grabs a few fish, holding them up for Drogan's approval.

Lunara, observing the interaction, speaks up. "We should set up camp soon. The forest grows darker by the minute, and we'll need our strength for the challenges ahead."

The group moves along the stream bank, searching for a place to settle for the night. Drogan, fish in hand, starts preparing a fire pit. His hands move with practiced ease, arranging the kindling and stones. With a focused gesture, he summons a controlled flame, setting the fire ablaze. As the fish cook over the fire, the aroma wafts through the camp.

Eorhelm, sitting by the fire, examines the amulet and parchment retrieved from the Hobgoblin Leader. "These markings, I've not seen their like before. We should seek out a scholar or sage who might decipher their meaning."

When the meal is ready, the party gathers around to enjoy the fruits of Drogan's labor. While not a gourmet meal, it satisfies the party's hunger, and the crispy skin of the fish bring commendation. The party members eat their fill, appreciating the simple but filling meal.

The group settles in for the night, taking turns on watch. The forest whispers around them, a symphony of nocturnal life. In the distance, the mountains loom, holding secrets yet to be unveiled.

Lunara and the Automaton take first watch. The Automaton discovers a small, hidden campsite not far from their own. Using its advanced sensors, it observes two cloaked figures huddled around a low-burning fire, engaged in a hushed conversation. The Automaton records their exchange and relays the information to Lunara. The figures discuss a temple deep within the forest, said to contain ancient artifacts. The figures also hint at the temple's location.

[To be continued.]

## Chapter 1: The Obsidian Marshlands

In the murky, treacherous expanse of the Obsidian Marshlands, Ragnar Blackclaw, a master of stealth and assassination, leads his party into an ancient, decaying watchtower. The marsh, cloaked in a thick, sulfuric fog, is rumored as both the home of the Level 91 Floor Boss and also the magical source of hallucinations throughout the region. Searching for the source of the hallucinations, Ragnar and his diverse team of warriors, mages, and rangers navigate the dangers within the tower. Twisted black trees and knee-deep muck surround them, while faint whispers seem to beckon them further. Deep inside, they discover a hidden chamber bathed in a faint, pulsating glow. Crystals hum softly along the walls, channeling magic toward a glowing orb on a pedestal. Sensing immense magical power, the party hesitates to take direct action and instead records information, hoping to return with reinforcements from the nearby town of Gloomhaven.

After retreating safely from the tower, Ragnar's party encounters a band of weary adventurers on the outskirts of the marsh. They exchange information but choose not to ally immediately, preferring to continue on their path, but agreeing to meet up at Gloomhaven in the day or two that follow to discuss potential alliance. Reaching Gloomhaven, the party engages in a training session near the town's edge, sharpening their skills for future battles. Despite their thirst for a low-level skirmish, no creatures emerge, and the group returns to the safety of the town for rest, planning to consult experts in magical artifacts the following day.

## Chapter 1: The History of Solara

In its prime, the Time-Worn Empire, now known as Antiqua, was called the Empire of Solara. This grand empire was renowned for its advancements in various fields, including architecture, astrology, and magic. The Solarans, as the inhabitants were known, were a people deeply connected to the sun and celestial bodies, which influenced their culture, religion, and daily life. Their society was structured around the worship of the sun, which they believed was the source of all life and magic.

The Solarans were known for their skill in astronomy and astrology, using their knowledge of the stars and celestial events to guide their decisions and shape their understanding of the universe. They built massive observatories and temples dedicated to the sun, many of which now lie in ruins within Antiqua. Their architecture often featured sun motifs, and they were skilled in creating artifacts that harnessed solar energy.

The Solarans are considered the predecessors of several modern cultures in Evergreen. The knowledge and traditions of the Solarans have been passed down and adapted in various forms across different regions. Regalis was notably founded by Solarans. Aetheria and the Celestial Archipelago have substantial proportions of Solaran ancestry. It is also notable that virtually none of the modern inhabitants of Antiqua are Solaran. Some who claim Solaran descent and travel through the region complain of a unique illness, and some are never heard from again.

The causes of the downfall of Solara are a favorite topic of the scholars of Evergreen. The causes were manifold, touch on many of the national and royal stories of Evergreen, and are also not fully understood. Their empire was frequently involved in territorial despitutes and smaller wars going back to its founding. Interesting magical signatures and fields bearing some similarity to time magic are found in particular concentration around Antiqua. This curse on the former capital region seemed to cause a weakening in leadership combined with a mass exodus, and the further arms of the empire subsequently fell or reorganized into other nations over time.

## On Biomagical Speciation

_By Thorion Silverleaf, Professor of Biomagic_

The species of modern Evergreen began in a similar way to earth. Bacteria gave rise to marine arthropods and fish through an equivalent to the Cambrian explosion. Amphibians evolved and more complicated ancient animals, including the dragons and many that remain.

This is where the similarities diverge, and the latest biomagical anthropology makes the contribution of our own elven race clear. Due in large part to our advanced cognitive abilities, and to a lesser extent to some contribution from other notable races, our world retains a flourishing of magic that Earth would not attain for additional 219.2 million years, according to current best estimates from Magnaria et al.

Earth suffered a major asteroid impact that wound back its evolutionary clock an estimated 65 million years. Evergreen has had several impacts, but none in equivalent severity. Evergreen is positioned slightly closer to our star, and our three moons make the lunar situation a bit different. As a result, we are better protected from issues like asteroid impact, and our evolutionary tree has gone much further.

The closest extinction event for us would be the Great Flare, but it occured far later in our evolutionary history, so that the First Elves, closely related to modern High Elves, had practiced open access to the mental plane for over ten million years. The dragons, fae, merfolk, lunari, and even some humans had also attained magical access, not to mention the technological success that Evergreen had achieved across races. The lower races such as the goblins contributed some technical shielding against the flare, even while they lacked ability to contribute to the Stellar Magiplex, the primary tool used for mitigation against the Great Flare.

The current paper focuses on the order of speciation. Using the latest of all nine years of the Royal Biomagical Survey, we finally have conclusive statistical evidence that species on the elvish line attained magical access early than any other hominid, far earlier than the humans, and only slightly behind the dragons. Admittedly, comparing access to the mental field between elves and dragons is a bit of an unfair comparison. Their access, through an oversized and biomagically primitive lizard brain, leverages different techniques than ours, resulting in a very distinct set of abilities, even if they both operate through fifth-dimensional cognitive pressure.

Humans, on the other hand, developed premental technologies first, and only far later adapted direct planar access. Evidence from the literature on human anthropolical neurology suggests a consensus that the ancient human brain, like the ancient human eye, was capable of mental planar observation but not generally capable of remote mental vocalization until later adaptations took place, potentially associated with post-flare environmental pressure. Even today, only a minority of humans can directly and consistently access the mental plane without the use of tools. For the elf, access failure is a rare and tragic medical condition.

An interesting divergence occurred in the aquatic realm, where dolphins, already intelligent, evolved into two distinct yet related races. The Lunari and the merfolk, both possessing powerful forms of mental manipulation and water affinity, fall short of the elven range in kind of magical ability. The Lunari, lovers of the moon, find solace in the night, shunning the sun's harsh light, much like the creatures of the deep. The merfolk, bound to the water, are limited in their terrestrial capabilities.

For the human, succesful access and manipulation is the abnormality. Evolving from our common ancestors in the apes, their journey was mostly marked by mere survival rather than flourishing. To their credit, their modern civilization is far more glorious than many of the beastfolk, and it is well-known that magic among the ape-descended beastfolk is even rarer than among the humans. Overall, humans placed right-of-center in our survey of the races. It is worth noting that our survey excluded orcs, celestials, and non-sentient biomagica such as the elementals, magical flora, and magical bacteria.

The celestial exemption is first due to their detachment from our evolutionary tree and secondly because it is inappropriate to assess celestials as a single race. Rather, they are a collection of various biomagical lineages which would need to be seperately assessed. Orcs do not participate in the Royal Survey because magic is so rare in their race that recruiting participants is infeasible and any analysis of those participants would be of only minimal utility considering the overwhelming selection bias.

Humans generally outperformed the beastfolk, although some aberrations were noted for highly magical foxfolk and birdfolk, calling for a rethinking of their usual evolutionary story. Marine and amphibian beastfolk including the merfolk and frogfolk were moderately proficient on average. The lunari performed nearly as well as elves, only deficient by 0.2 standard deviations on average, with gnomes close behind. Lizardfolk and dwarves performed about as well as humans.

The result on merfolk and lunari is not entirely surprising, given their early evolutionary divergence from other mammals. Avoiding the ape line entirely, this group is closer to dolphins or whales. While the often appear humanlike, this is on account of their image manipulation abilities. In their natural forms they appear rather different. Similarly, the evolution of frogfolk is relatively early to humans from an evolutionary perspective.

In conclusion, the evolutionary journey of each race in Evergreen speaks volumes of their place in the world. The elves, with our deep connection to both the natural plane and the mental or magicl plane, and particularly the high elves, stands as the epitome of what biomagical evolution can achieve. This is not something to take lightly, but is instead a great responsibility placed directly in our hands, one might say, by the Great Mother and her First Children, the Laws of Nature. We stand as the custodians of the world's beauty and harmony, a role that the lesser races, with their mundane origins and simpler forms, can scarcely comprehend.
