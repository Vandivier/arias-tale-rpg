title: "Prompt Log - Arc Aria"
---

This document gives a behind-the-scenes technical look at prompts used to play campaign sessions that were eventually included into the canon.

The main purpose here is to illustrate prompting techniques in order to provide value to future game masters. A secondary purpose is traceability and transparency for reproducibility and to satisfy the curiosity of the simply curious, who may wonder what sort of prompt led to a certain outcome.

These prompts should not be mistaken for best practices. Sometime prompts are poorly done, but they are provided anyway. Sometimes there are typos, and they are left in. In some cases typos or poor prompt expression directly explain results including both canonized outcomes and also bloopers.

Some prompts have been updated or removed. In particular, prompts requesting a scene draw or refreshing context with metagame information are purged.

---

1. [Metagame Instructions, then] Roll a random character in the game. What is their race, class, gender, description, and do they remember logging in?
2. Roll a second character, and include their name
3. For the human warrior that remembers logging in, they are going to be played by Mike. This will also be the in-game character's player name. They decided to name the character Tank. Provide a description with the same details for a third character that is a female and let's say she does remember logging in.
4. One day in the early afternoon, Tank faintly hears a doorbell buzz in real life. Realizing his pizza has arrived, he attempts to logout. He is struck by terror as he finds that he cannot log out. Suddenly the sky turns an burnt orange color and a massive semi-ethereal and a shadowy figure appears in sky. In an unfamiliar and powerful voice, this figure confirms that players cannot log out until the boss on the 100th floor is defeated. The figure suggests that players should form groups or guilds, as he has increased the power of one monster on each floor to such an extent that even strongest max-level player cannot beat the first floor boss. With that, the figure disappears and the sky resumes it's normal appearance. Where does Aria find herself in this region?
5. Tank intentionally decides to take nearby shelter and carefully view all happenings for the next hour. Even if it appears safe, he intentionally hides and shelters, despite his massive frame.
6. Eidolon is in good health with basic inventory including a bow and light armor. After the terrifying announcement, Eidolon reacts entirely undeterred. They realize they have no recollection of logging in and can't even remember their own identity. They are wondering if they are a robot or a real-life human playing a game. Desiring to uncover the mystery of what's going on, they have the intuition that the Lake of Whispers could reveal useful information. They look around and develop confidence that a certain path will take them to water. They dart down the path only to find a strange plant monster. This plant monster is making a sound similar to running water. The plant monster surprises Eidolon by lashing out. Considering Eidolon's abilities, do they inflict any damage, or do they dodge this initial attack?
7. What does this plant do on their turn? They can only take a single action, and you should not assume Eidolon's reaction.
8. Print the technical D&D stat sheet for Eidolon, a level 2 elf rogue, and this weak plant monster.
9. The plant monster attacked with the acid spit and rolled 12. Describe the impact on Eidolon
10. Eidolon activates his Fae Ancestry ability and attacks
11. Concerned about the situation, Aria travels to the nearest town and seeks to form a team. Does Aria pass by either Eidolen or Tank on her way to town? Or is her visit unknown to them? Do not leave any ambiguity in the narration of events. Pick yes or no.
12. Eidolen realizes they walked away from the Lake towards this monster. After defeating the monster, they intuit that they have walked directly away from the lake. They collect a medium-large Poisonous Monster Tooth from the fallen monster, and search for the tallest tree around and attempt to scale it. Are they successful?
13. Eidolen looks for three things: The nearby town, Monsters, and Other players. He rolls 4d20 as follows: 3, 1, and 20.
14. Tank has now been sitting behind a small bush for about an hour. At one point they saw a small monster pass by, but otherwise, nothing eventful occurred. He wears a bronze chest piece, bronze boots, a one-handed wooden spear, and a one-handed wooden shield. Reflecting on the fact that he has added no friends in the game, he isn't upset but he finds it rather unfortunate. He decides that he should go to town and form a party. He does this for two reasons: to survive and to gather a war party and face the boss. On the path to town his boots make a bit noise, not too much, but enough to catch the attention of a larger-than-normal and aggressive squirrel-like monster. This monster is convinced that your are walking into its territory. What does it do?
15. Tank forms a defensive stance, putting his shield up and preparing his spear. He anticipates the squirrel monster to lunge and prepares to counter. What happens?
16. From his advantaged position, Tank attacks, landing a solid strike. What happens next?
17. For an instant, Tank has a quick migraine-shooting headache and his vision is replaced by a picture of a computer circuit architecture, with a current flowing through it. Does he recover in time for the next round to continue normally or is he momentarily stunned? Does the monster seem to have any experience or reaction?
18. Does the squirrel stand its ground, throw a ranged object, or physically charge Tank?
19. Tank shields the assault, taking no damage, but he feels the cheap wooden shield starting to weaken. Another hit like that, and it might just crack. Feeling his defensive stance wane, Tank doubles down on aggressive action: He stabs at the squirrel. The stab is a bit sloppy but connects anyway. Despite the agility of the squirrel, it fails to dodge. The attack deals light damage. What happens next?
20. As the squirrel monster circles Tank, it eventually places itself away from the direction of the town, where Tank would like to go. Tank resumes a defensive stance himself, being aware of their battle drawing slightly more attention, and carefully walks in the direction of the town. The squirrel is no more or less antagonized by this direction of walking. What happens next?
21. A smaller squirrel-like monster leaps at Tank's pack from behind, swiping to tear it with sharp claws. This small monster misses, but the shock jolts Tank into an adrenaline-fueled extra move. Tank uses this energy to burst down the path towards the town at full tilt and escapes successfully. Soon, he finds himself in the town. As he arrives, he neither notices the crowds gathering at the center of town nor is he noticed by them. Still, he sees a character or two walking about. The scene now focuses on Eidolon. Eidolon watched the battle between Tank and the monsters. Eidolon is now confident about the direction of the town. Eidolon wonders if they are seeing reality, then becomes convinced that there is an alarming magic power in the forest. Eidolon would like to visit town, but they are not being too hasty and they ensure that they can navigate to the town in a safe and roguelike way. Eidolon looks around but doesn't notice any monsters. They still believe that there are monsters around based on their recent experiences as well as watching Tank. They descend the tree and head directly toward the town, despite the fact that there is no well-beaten path. They are slowed by vegetation but maintain a stealthy approach. At one point, Eidolon does notice a group of beasts. In order to maintain stealth, he slows a bit and goes unnoticed. Back in town, Aria issues a general call to gather a warband to find and destroy the first-floor boss. Describe what occurs in three steps. How successful is she? Does the town rally around her or fragment into multiple groups?
22. There are approximately 300 characters in the town. About two-thirds of these characters are player characters. How many of these characters join Aria's team compared to other teams or stay alone? Tank hears about the vast majority of these groups, even some of the smaller ones. How many groups are there?
23. Tank looks around for any group that is in need of a tank-build character. He is interested in a bit of grinding so that he can level up. He is not currently interested in joining Aria's group. He finds five groups that fit this description to varying extents and spends more than an hour learning about these groups. The groups respond positively, and all exhibit interest and share their background.
24. Tank expresses an interest in joining The Shield Bearers. They are happy to have him join. They would like him to show some skin in the game, loyalty, or allegiance by giving him some task or burden. Describe what they request.
25. Tank doesn't want to go through this initiation right, but the group doesn't care. The healer seems to be the leader. 'At this point, you have expressed interest. Our lives are on the line, we won't have you back out.' They coerce him into a nearby house which has a trap door. He mutters unhappily under his breath and reluctantly enters.
26. Tank immediately attempts to sprint past the monster. The monster reaches out another hand, causing another wall of metal to shoot in from without the corridor, this time cutting Tank in half. He dies.
27. Tank checks the system game log. He sees that the healer revived him after he was killed by the elemental golem. He sees no other useful information. In the meantime, Eidolon arrives in town. Eidolon enters stealthily but does not notice The Shield Bearers. Eidolon does notice the tavern, inn, armor shop, and commotion near the square. Eidolon senses a moral negative energy on the part of The Mercenaries and temporarily wonders about who is paying these people. Eidolon reflects on his own moral compass, which seems aligned indifferently toward religious concepts and the behavior of the mercenaries. In the morning, what has Aria been up to?
28. Aria's team hasn't yet found the boss, but they are able to rule out one wild location. Which location is ruled out?
29. Tank has joined The Shield Bearers. Their healer is their leader. The group hears that Aria's team has cleared The Lake of Whispers, so the healer-leader decides that this will be a perfect training ground for the team. As the group walks, Tank learns a bit more about the group including their names. The mage remains the most mysterious. Describe these characters in more detail. Give the stat sheets for the warriors, and only backstory for the other two.
30. The Shield Bearers walk along a well-made path to The Lake of Whispers from the town, crossing through an unremarkable grassy area. They come to the lake and it is a sunny day without a strong breeze. They see some characters and monsters here and there. The mage points to a medium-sized lizardlike monster near the edge of the water. 'That one,' says the mage. The other warriors train briefly with Tank, trying to show him their phalanx formation which is the signature move of the warriors in this group.
31. Lyra attacks first, then the lizard monster acts, then Kael. What happens?
32. You say that Kael is 'aiming for a decisive blow that could potentially disable or seriously injure the creature.' He in fact rolls 15 on a 1d20 attack roll. Give the stat sheet for this monster and describe the damage points.
33. "Tank launches a Defensive Strike, trying to harm the Lizard, but giving priority to the defense of the healer behind him. He rolls 15 on a 1d20."
34. "We see another monster in the distance begin to pay attention, but they do not yet approach. It is Lyra's turn, then the Lizard, then Kael. What happens next?"
35. "The Lizard is down to 19 health. Lyra took 6 points of damage. Tank fails to do any damage this round, but succeeds in protecting the healer. The healer waves toward Lyra. She seems not only fully healed, but also strengthened and invigorated. It is now Lyra's turn. What happens?"
36. "The Lizard takes 16 points of damage. The other onlooking monster decides to leave the group alone. What does the Lizard do on its turn?"
37. "The mage waves and a crack of lightning finishes off the monster."
38. "Tank levels up to level 2 and unlocks the Phalanx move which is a team move for the shield bearers, using the three shielded warriors to form a defense augmented by the priest. It's now the world's turn. Does anything interesting happen?"
39. "Eidolon would like to look for shops that sell health potions and daggers."
40. "How much does a health potion cost (use DND 5e)"
41. "Eidolon buys a health potion spending all of his gold, fails to convince the guild to visit the Ruins, and succeeds in convincing the group to train at the crossroads. One member gifts a weakly enchanted cloth cap to protect from elemental magic. Remembering that The Crossroads of Elements is an Elemental Nexus, what monsters or events or items, if any, does Eidolon encounter? Bear in mind that the Crossroads is also a merchant trail to distant lands. Make a 1d6 check for encountering a friendly NPC (6 is success)."
42. "Don't outline potential encounters or events, declare a specific narration of what takes place (you are co-GM)"
43. "The elementals take out the robbers. Their swordsman is unconscious but still appears still breathing. A human fire mage on the elementalist's team is dead, otherwise her team survives. Eidolon takes the sword from the fallen robber swordsman and stabs him through the heart, yelling out 'Texas.' Draw a picture of this scene."
44. "Eidolon and The Elementalists loot the following: 1. A sword 2. Two daggers 3. A shortbow 4. A health potion 5. A bronze chestplate 6. three leather vests 7. a pair of leather boots 8. twelve gold pieces. the group also has the dead body of their fire mage, including his staff and mage robes. we end Eidolon's turn there; what will the earth elementals and merchant do next? what will become of the dead teammate? Eidolon and the earth mage both gain a level. What happens on Aria's turn? does her guild find the level boss?"
45. "Stop being ambiguous and narrate specific events. For example, do not say 'As they traverse a particularly dense area or reach a significant landmark, Aria's team might finally encounter the boss.' State whether they find it or not definitively (you are the decider)"
46. "Tank's team is near the Lake of Whispers when this dark energy blast occurs. They see it in the distance as a sort of mushroom cloud of dark energy. Tank consults with his party about what their course of action should be. What do they say? Gavriel responds that this must be the level boss, it seems to be using dark magic, and Gavriel can sense that Johan the fire mage is dead. What does the priest say? Does he want to flee, investigate, attack, or something else?"
47. "The team rallies around the plan of their leader, Elara the Priest, and heads south toward the mushroom cloud cautiously, but with high moral. What happens next?"
48. "Draw a picture of the boss fighting multiple guilds in the distance, as observed by Alara and the team."
49. "Tank recommends to the team that we should set up a triage station exactly where they stand and try to patch up the fleeing injured, and ready a counter. Tank notices there seem to be three guilds fighting the boss, and they seem to be winning, despite many casualties. Nine units temporarily join Tank and the Shield Bearers. One is guaranteed to be epic heroic level with a unique class. Describe these units and their race and classes."
50. "The Shield Bearers execute the Phalanx formation, including the Paladin, and charge the field. The boss takes notice and launches a long-range attack, but it is rebuffed. Draw an image of the scene as they charge in."
51. "Tank, his guild, and the allies take down the Dark Paladin, working together with the other three guilds. There were 54 additional casualties after his team charged in. It was estimated that victory would have taken twice as long and probably more than double the causalities if his team hadn't charged in. 6 casualties in Tank's assault. Briar, Kaelen, and Eryndor were not able to be revived. The Shield Bearers level up except for Gavriel. They receive 100 gold, 10 pounds of dark dragon scales, a dark dragon claw, and 10 pounds of dark wood. A portal opens up at the location, seemingly leading to the next level. A single group charges in eagerly, but the vast majority return to town to bury the dead and regroup."
52. "Tank and Elara seek to recruit Vaelor. They are unsuccessful, but Vaelor enjoys their company and thinks highly of the guld. Given the small size of the Shield Bearers, Vaelor invites the entire guild to merge with his. He is third in command of his medium-sized guild. His guild would like to grow to become the top guild. They are rivals of Aria's Guild. Tell us more about this guild."
53. "The guilds merge. Tank is now a member of the Crimson Vanguard. They have no left the scene of the previous battle. Summarize the current scene."
54. "Draw a picture of Elara and Thane shaking hands to seal the guild merger. Thane wears red."
55. "Summarize Eidolon's inventory"
56. "Eidolon sells 1. two leather vests 2. a bronze chestplate 3. a shortbow How many gold pieces does he receive?"
57. "Eidolon now has a total of 80 gold pieces after those sales. They then buy a scroll of detect magic for 20 gold pieces and gift an Earth Shard to the Dwarven Mage in the guild, who is an earth mage. Eidolon encounters a battle on the way back to the Crossroads of the Elements, which is on the way to the neighboring town with the collector who allegedly has a Tome of Resurrection. This is a level-1 encounter with 2 enemies that takes place on the road to the crossroads. The road is surrounded on both sides by forest. What enemies are encountered?"
58. "How many health points do the goblins have"
59. "Reyna is a wood elf who strikes a goblin with a 14 damage roll. how many damage points?"
60. "Draw the earth dwarf casting spire, which causes a large spike of earth to erupt and strike a goblin. Draw a tiny icicle coming all the way down from the clouds and striking the goblin form above as well. The goblins have been defeated. What loot did they leave?"
61. "Eidolon's team loots 8 gold and 2 goblin daggers. At the crossroads of the elements there is another encounter. There are 5 elementals of a single kind, and they seem to be expecting Eidolon's group. What are their kinds, stats, and abilities?"
62. "It is the turn for the earth elementals to take action. What do they do? There are only 4 now as one has been killed."
63. "Here is the opposing team: Valenia - A High Elf paladin and the leader of the guild. She wields a holy avenger sword and shield. Thom - A Half-Elf bard who provides inspirational songs and tales to motivate the guild. He carries a lute etched with scenes of historic battles. Reyna - A Wood Elf ranger and the tracker of the group. She is an expert marksman with the longbow. Durnan - A shield dwarf fighter who serves as the tank. He wears heavy plate armor and wields a warhammer and tower shield. Cutler - A forest gnome wizard specializing in illusion magic. He uses his tricks to confuse enemies. Pax - A Halfling cleric who tends to the guild's injuries with healing magic. She carries a wooden holy symbol. Eidolon - An elven rogue A dwarven earth mage Another Elven scout A human scout An Ice Specialist. What do the earth elementals do specifically? If they attack, who do they attack?"
64. "Eidolon's group does an all-out attack: Ice magic, illusion magic, multiple hand to hand combat and spells on the 2 remaining earth elementals that are above ground. Draw this. Remember they are at a crossroad."
65. "The next day, Thane leads a training exercise for a portion of the Crimson Vanguard, including the warriors of the former Shield Bearers. Where do they go?"
66. "Thane's group includes: 1. Thane 2. Tank 3. Lyra 4. Kael and two other members of the crimson vanguard. What are the races and classes for the two others? Here is a list of classes in the game, feel free to branch out: [list of classes] Note: both members are physical combat types. One is a rare class and the other is a unique class (stronger than rare or epic, often characterized with a unique story and abilities)"
67. "The training expedition encounters 5 enemies in the Whispering Woods. One is a high rarity, one is uncommon, and three are common rarity. We don't need to strictly conform to DnD 5e or anything else. These are level 5 monsters."
68. "Draw a picture of Tank having another migraine and seeing the eye again. This time the image is darker and he also see the Purple gate with a hand reaching out."
69. "Selena attacks the Shadow Stalker with two attacks. One connects and deals high damage. Tank is stunned for the round. Thane has spent his round ensuring the team did not receive a surprise attack. What happens in the rest of the round? Roll d20 for each character turn."
70. "Based on character speed, declare the order of turns. The Shadow Stalker is first, then the Blade Dancer, then Thane. What is the order for the others?"
71. "You have named characters that are not involved in this encounter. Remember, the current encounter is between Thane's group and the Shadow Stalker team. Eidolon's group is nowhere in sight."
72. "The two additional members of the Crimson Vanguard are Selena and the Half-Orc Bearkin Berserker."
73. "Where are the thorn monster and ghouls?"
74. "The hits in this round were as follows: 1. Thorned Entangler had medium success 2. Forest Ghoul 1 landed a strong hit 3. Forest Ghoul 2 landed a strong hit 4. Kael landed a critical hit. Who did they attack and using what ability? Do not give 'likely' explanations: Take the roll of game master and pick specifically."
75. "For round 2, Thane and Tank can also act. Give the turn order, considering the Shadow Stalker is stunned."
76. "Roll 1d20 for each character. Everyone is using basic attacks (feel free to modify this for the enemies as you please). Remember, Selena has a basic attack with two strikes in it, so roll 2d20 for her. Interpret the rolls this way: [roll interpretation criteria] Before declaring the individual turns, make a 1d20 environment check: if the roll is over 15 trigger an environment event. Here are the roll results: [dice roll results]"
77. "Thane takes light damage, Thane destroys the Thorned Entangler, and the Shadow Stalker takes moderate damage. Draw this."
78. "Forest Ghoul 3 - This ghoul joins the fray, targeting any vulnerable member of Thane's group. Pick a specific target."
79. "The ghoul has high damage on Selena."
80. "Now that the Thorned Entangler is gone, write out the turn order for the next round."
81. "Does anything in the environment happen?"
82. "Thane retreats from combat and Selena kills a Ghoul. The Shadow Stalker is down. What is the remaining turn order?"
