title: "Prompt Log - Arc Ezekiel"
---

This document gives a behind-the-scenes technical look at prompts used to play campaign sessions that were eventually included into the canon.

The main purpose here is to illustrate prompting techniques in order to provide value to future game masters. A secondary purpose is traceability and transparency for reproducibility and to satisfy the curiosity of the simply curious, who may wonder what sort of prompt led to a certain outcome.

These prompts should not be mistaken for best practices. Sometime prompts are poorly done, but they are provided anyway. Sometimes there are typos, and they are left in. In some cases typos or poor prompt expression directly explain results including both canonized outcomes and also bloopers.

Some prompts have been updated or removed. In particular, prompts requesting a scene draw or refreshing context with metagame information are purged.
